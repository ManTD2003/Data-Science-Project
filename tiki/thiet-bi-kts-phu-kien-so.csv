"Tiki super-speed, 11th night, which next afternoon, we're getting cheap satire, we're adding discount code, we're good off the table, we're all using logs."

"You know, once you won a mouse, you spent a lot of these years using four years without a battery, so this rat quality doesn't have to change, so you don't have to tell me how long it takes a friend to buy a wireless mouse to buy a mouse and buy a mouse."
"Thank the suppliers, the manufacturers, the vendors, thank the salesmen, thank the electronics floor, thank the carriers for this opportunity to use this kind of good product."
"I only judge the mouse with the item I got, the quality after the update, the good delivery, the new mouse, the one I used to buy in pv and the other two years I should buy it back."

"- The face on the mouse only says ""logi"" rather than ""logfox"". - The S/N on the box, the mouse on the mouse, after learning the correct conclusion of the company itself."
"You know, they're sensitive, but they don't seem familiar, so they're kind of weird, and they get fast tikiships, and they're small sounds, and if they don't notice it, they don't seem to hear it, but at first they're a little nervous, but they're cool to buy it."
"Soft press, extremely small sound, fine completion, slightly small size, smaller than his old mouse"

"I bought these two mice, I used them for good, but a couple of months they're broken. every time I change my batteries and fuck my other computers, I get changed, but a few months later, it's broken, and today's the third day, and it's a waste of time, and it's a waste of money."

"Tiki nock to deliver fast because she doesn't have time, but she calls to notice at 11:45, while she's busy doing another job."
"What do you mean, a Logotech rat on the inside with the word Logo?"
"Superstitious clicks don't hear any sounds, super appropriate for the students in the group not to be afraid to disturb others who are resting, but the big subtraction must be too small, long-term tired with a patient's wrist."
"The store's like a blubber, it's just a rat, it's a hack, it's a USB gate, it's not working. For the first time, the tiki experience is the last time, the shop has been delivered a little longer, but it's a bit more prestigious, the shop's a piece of business, ostracism..."
"When you open it, you can see that the mouse box is broken, the seal is cut like this. Take the mouse for a temporary test, okay, but you can't accept the seal being torn apart like that. You need a proper explanation."
"He said he'd got a gift, but he only got a mouse."
I bought two rats for less than a year and I can't use them right now.
"Use it well, quickly to the remote control distance. However, it is not appropriate to play games because the mouse is not balanced, it is easy to lean left, it is difficult to lose the deadly pace"
"You don't know how to use it well, but it's fine, it's not loud, it's not loud, it's still good for logos, it's good for them, it's good for them, it's good for them, it's good for them, it's good for them, it's good for them, it's good for them, it's good for them, it's good for them, it's good for them, it's good for them."
"It's easy to use, it's only been a few days, it's okay."
"You're wrong. You know the quality is the same, but you've got to be right. You've got to be right."
I've been on the mouse for two months and I can't connect the computer.
Wrong buy for trade.
A present from Tiki Trading is the Logotech calendar that hasn't been delivered with sp...
"Before receiving things you're worried about accuracy and feeling press, but when you get your row is very pleased:--dot: + good press + good sensitivity + good precision + special know very quiet is consistent with you or working the night like yourself + little mouse easy to move - > Compensates fit to be office + pretty small mouse who's big hands won't like + baby snag"
"You buy two mice, you can't use a rat, you need to trade them."
The mouse does not receive the white background used on the _dell computer. Your mouse has failed a left click. The mouse is silent.
I'll see if it's okay to buy a quick delivery.
"The order bought both books and mice, and eventually only books, which had no success in contact with four days, and Tiki’s business became unreputed."
"Hopefully, compared to just a computer mouse, there's not going to be as bad an experience as complex electron sp as flycams that cost money, but leave the missing parts."
"I've got the mouse, I've got the peach branch, I don't know if the rat's going to light the lights on, but my mouse's not going to light up."
"Rats OK, but you should specify sp's color in the product title rather than the image's color is actually not the same as the illustration image."
"I've only spent three months and the wheelchair's got scroll all over the place, so where's the warranty connection?"
"Use the good price, let's see how long it lasts."
"Bad mouse, open the box and you won't be able to use it."
It doesn't work. The new batteries don't work either.
"The battery and the mouse have been turned over to the top, but the mouse has not been on the power, it can't be used."
"You've got the right combination, you've got the right chat with the store. Contact me again, okay?"
"If you want to buy a pillow with a bag of cloth, you don't have one and you don't call the number in the box to contact it, you can't contact it."
"The key is up, the left button is not sensitive but gentle"
It's not sustainable.
"Rats just bought them, they didn't use them until Monday, first day."
"CONTRIBUTIONS ARE OK, DIFFERENT DIFFERENTS ARE UNDERSTANDED."
"Why would the mouse you bought open the flash drive to your laptop, but the red flash under the mouse didn't light up?"
"I just got it, I turned on my computer to check the mouse for lights."
"It's good, it's good... it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good."
"Put the batteries on, but no lights on, Tiki."
"We just got the package, we can't use it, we're asking the supplier to return it."
"If you don't match the serial, then you don't have the light on your foot."
"It's okay, but it's a little small for a man."

"It's broken, it's not working, it's got a warranty."

"It's easy, it's good, it's new."
It's two-day SD: enough 6Gb data coming through the new day; speed depends on the grid area.
"I bought it for 319K, but I bought it fast in the morning, and with the right instructions, it was 6gb, and the network at TPHCM was strong, so it's relatively OK, if I just watch movies, listen to music, surf the web, it's really good, I don't play games, so I feel good at the price."
I've been buying sim 3G/4G on Tiki for many years.
"The new mk is still available. OK. What's up for next update: I'm sv in Hanoi, the network isn't fast and strong, sometimes not 4G at all, but 3G or H+ very slowly, like yesterday wants to call someone close to life faster, kp, but if to use normal, take it easy, the Web is OK, generally, for this price is acceptable, but for those who need it fast, stable, shouldn't use this sim/s (p/p/p/k)."

"When you're finished, the waves are good, the utube is stable, you follow the direction of the shop, you activate the 6gb package every day. When you install the sim, right. App Bima automatically accepts sim. It's too convenient. It's going to increase after a year of use:D"
"The network is fast, it's stable, it's six hours, but it's actually only four hours, and after four hours, it's still online, but it's slow, it's not working, it's okay for me."
"There's no chance we're going to wake up, we're gonna put it in the car, so we're gonna add this event, we're gonna load apps, and we're gonna find that it's been a little weird for 158 days."
"We used two sims of this, and now we've bought them for all of us, and we've got 4G, which is pretty stable in the city."

"Let's hope the biobags are environmentally protected, RlCO, service OK, quick delivery, 36 hours with goods, waves OK, depending on where they're slow, activate the sims easy, credit cards, one point minus plastic bags."
"After a year of using it, I went back for the second time, and it was amazing. Guys, I was stupid not to know sooner, and I used the 300K vietter package a month with four hours a day, and this one was 6g, and I let the door go, and I watched N10tvride gas."
"The package is on schedule. The sim is 300MB. About two hours later, the app updates to 6GB in shape."
"If you want to buy it, check if it's good to cover the waves and buy it."
"It's very satisfying to use bima to check all the information, use one year a day every 6 p.m., not for long, so there's no further evaluation."
"Sim OK, bought one from the shop."
"The delivery is fast, the sim is easy to install and use, the store is passionately accompanied by paper that activates the package. The wave is stable, the network is good."
"The package is so careful that no one can reach tiki, the amount of sim fai that's using time to figure it out right now is stable."
"Good use... even though the bandwidth is high, but stable is good."

It's very convenient to buy it for free. It's good to sell it as a description.
"The time we don't know how to use it, but it's still five stars."
The speed's fine. Six hours a day. It's pretty irresponsible.
Good. lt's back. It's strong.
Very good.
That's why it's only 6gb.

"I don't know if it's 6g/day or not, but 3g is too slow in front of me, and my friends and I both feel like the speed of sim Vietnammobiles is too slow to use."
"As far as the price is too high, it's acceptable to be in Tranquillity Town, to be in the center, to spend 70 percent of the sim and 30 percent of the time in music and web surf, and to be smooth at times, but at some point it's too fast to go to Tuoitre website.v.v... which is generally the price and quality level of satisfaction... if you want to use 4g as fast as you can play the game, don't let it go."
Sim's got a strong network. Good luck. Call a man in the country.
The speed network is almost empty.
"Sim was never 4G, he wasn't stable, he was just a few Mbps, he didn't even have any Mbps."
"I've spent some time and I've seen pretty bad bandwidth even though I'm in Hanoi, and I'm in the province, and I'm getting worse."
"Sims are weak, slow, about 60 percent simbi, and cheap Ham has been bought for a month, and it's been changed to viettel/mobi."
"Slow speed, no six hours a day like advertising."
"Sim Max Data 4G uses very poor use, a commercial that uses 6GB a day, but ends 2GB with a network kill off for an hour or two, and then is virtually unloadable, which is very, very poor, much worse than 3G vinaphone, and if I can give it back, I'll give it back."
"The speed says it's temporary. <i>No more share of the network.</i> <i>This price should be less than 1.g. But the network is OK, as powerful as vina or viettel.</i>"
"Fast delivery, low cost, exactly as advertised, but because of the aminomobile network, it's a little weak (out in the open, it's pretty slow in the house)"
"The shop supports the technical problem in time and enthusiasm, and is still resuscitating the rate of the network when it's not going to be the case."
"It's okay. It's still six o'clock a day, but when you're moving in the car, you can't get a message, and there's a place where you can get a lot of air, it's kind of annoying."
Sim was locked in after a month of use.
"Let me ask you, did I buy sim on April 14, 2023, but after I activated the short-term message check using the SHOPEE6G package only until June '2023?"
The wave of weakness is unstable or disconnected.
"The speed delivery, the price ok, the package is carefully packed and the trigger manual will support the Shop."
"I bought this sim, but I can't get Wi-Fi out of this sim. People should consider it when they buy it."
"The network is too weak, it's too lame, it's useless, you shouldn't buy it, it's still not working at the center."
It's boring. Use it in HN. Don't come out and run.

"The store delivers the goods, but this sim is so bad, we're in the middle of the capital, we're so slow, the others don't know how fast, it's just a little over two hours."
"Placed two sims, installed one sim, network is slow and pretty slow, not like advertising."
Sim buys a year and spends less than two months of her time with her body. She can't use it anymore.
"The waves are very weak, right now, TPHCM, or in Flatland, and there are only two waves."
"The delivery is fast.5* But Sims is 4G is weak, he shouldn't buy, he's a joint judge."
"IT'S UNDERSTAND, FOR 3 MONTHS IT'S UNDERSTANDED"
"Sim restricts phones and laptops, other devices that don't work."
"The salesman's okay, but the Internet's bad, the waves are bad, and sometimes it's something to say about not being able to use, it's a waste!"
"You can't just run away, fac, shop... let alone goole."
The network's too poor to be bought.
The network is slower than a bull turtle.
Enough demand.
"The speed is very low, the connection is often lost!"
"Sim bought one month until April 14,2022 no longer working, no contact with operator 789 as before?"
"New sim, self-activated through the operator, the brand-new brand-new store, but the Ottonamobile's wave quality is still weak."
"It's too weak, it's not working, it's boring."
"The waves are so weak, they're almost useless, they can't do anything about it."
The network's too slow.
The speed is good within the price range.
"The speed of weakness, the distance from Hanoi, is almost gone."
"Sim Ok, use it a few days. OK."
The speed on the network is too slow to get into the network.
Sim Load 4g is extremely slow.

"Slow as a turtle, like a snail."
"Took a month to deliver July, and started June."
"It's a short wave, four hours too weak, but it's at fourcm."
"There's too much junk messages, there's a lot of advertising."
The wave quality is too short.
The sim works. Our network's a little weak.
It's boring how bad the network is. It's so boring.
"It's bad in the house. It's bad in the house. Come on, it's okay."
The sim works just as well as the introduction.
This is exactly what the commercial looks like.
Network speed 4G is too slow for advertising.

Not sensitive on the dark floor.
Okay.
This is the first time I've chosen tiki.
"In due course, the mouse looks very pretty, and the one you charge is always following instructions and exactly two and a half hours later it's full of self-sustaining batteries."
"I spent two weeks, and now I'm out of sorts, and I'm in touch with the shop for a few days, and there's no response, and the worst experience of all the tiki stores."
"It's a compliment, the mouse is very smooth, the response is good, the delay is low, there's no noise, there's a package store, there's a five-star store."
"Unloaded delivery, clicked without a DM. 15-minute battery, always unloaded. Six-and-a-half times the power, and then the light went red, and it didn't light up."
"It's a bit of a weak delivery, it's a good description, it's good enough for the money. The mouse connects the rpd (not the web port) is very convenient for using the tablet for students to support the translation season."
"The real goods are fast delivery, good quality, good good goods, well packed, well worth the money."
"Very cute pink is always looking a lot better out there, buying at a time when it's going to be high, and the store is going to be ready fast, and the delivery is going to be fast."
"I can't believe that in this price, you can find a rat that's as good as this, that click is super smooth, that sensitivity is off the table, quality actually."
"You can't buy it, you can't use it, you can't use it, you can't use it on the top button, you can't click it, but you can't use it, you can turn it off on the table."
"The mouse does not connect after the head charge, the text has not yet been shown, hoping to be resolved soon."
"Pretty mouse, pretty touch, good quality, elegant color, should buy fast delivery... which is pretty good for a price..."
"Hand-held, pretty good-surfed pawns. It's pretty convenient to connect Bluetooth to a store."
Good product.
"The middle mouse is non-silent. Click with a microphone wire. Usb makes the bottom of the mouse, which has to be removed for use if you use a Bluetooth connection style."
"It's a good mouse, it's good to buy it, it's good to borrow it, it's strong, it's good to buy it."
"The mouse goes soft, sensitive, quality is good for the price of money."
"The old stuff, web's thicker than rats, no rats."
"The mouse is as sensitive as the handle, the delivery shop is as fast as the rocket that set the afternoon before the next morning theship goes, five stars."
"Rats match the price, tiki delivered quickly."
"Beautiful, comfortable-held rats have to use the quality of their hands for a while to find out."
"The product is exactly what it says: - Do not make noise - slide soft, sensitive - beautiful colors will support the shop."
"Hold tight, easy to connect."
The product's okay.
It's pretty good. It's a buffalo battery.
"It's okay, it's good, but it's not good."
The new mouse uses it for a few days. It's not working anymore.
The goods and the quality of the delivery were faster than expected.
"Very good, fast delivery, long-term batteries."
"Soft clicks, quick intersections"
"The mouse fits, the battery lasts a long time."
The mouse can't connect the bolt.
TERRIA
I can't even charge it!
I got the product correctly described earlier when I bought a cheaper price (at another store) for a few times.
The product's good.
The charge's too good. Okay. We'll back it up later.
It's fine. It's a fair price. It's going to support the shop.

"It's good. It's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good."
"The charge line is good, the delivery is quick, the clock is right, so you can change the charge line immediately."
"The object is good, it makes sense with the price, but magnets are a little small, so gravity is a little low."
"Okay, goat."
"It's loaded with a used, weak magnet, proper delivery, carefully packed."
You take good care of your customers.
"The good product is within range, packed carefully, delivered quickly"
Good.
"The wire matches the clock, thanks shop's already on it."
"I put four cores in two cores, but it's still good and good."
"It's not compatible with the Hero clock, it's due to lack of magnetism!"
"Fast delivery, carefully packed and exactly like qc."
"Good sp, charged with watch. Thanks for the consulting shop."
Everything's fine.
Quick charge

"No, Saigon must be sad. It's true."
"It's not Band Six. It's two locusts, but it's a lot shorter on the side."
"The battery's been charged three or four times, the battery's in good, but then the grasshopper is down, so we can't charge it, we don't know how to get it out."
"New wire, secure packing!"
"You can't buy the wrong wire, you can't try it, you can't give it to him for four stars, you can't give it to him."
High pass van Dyer
"It's so far apart, it's not the same as the clock, it can't charge."
"The charge looks good, but I bought the wrong samples for your smart watch."
It's not a coincidence with the clock in exchange.
"We bought the same wire as the clock, told the shop to deliver the one that fits the clock, gave it to the wire that didn't fit the clock, didn't charge it."
"It's weak, it's easy to fall, it's short so it's hard when the battery comes in."
"Bad touch, good time, bad time."
I can't use it. It's a waste of money. You guys.
"Magnets are too weak, they're very vulnerable to charge."
Doesn't fit my watch.
does not match the size of the clock
It's about being where it's supposed to be.
"It won't come in, it won't come in, it doesn't matter which money it belongs to."
"The breath force isn't big enough, it's easy to fall while charging."
"I'll buy it for you, so I don't have any idea."
Normal
I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine.
You can't afford the wrong thing.
Okay.
"The mouse colors are so beautiful and so beautiful and so beautiful and so realistic, and the mouse is holding the dress, and for sure, I can see that the soft click is not exactly as loud as advertising, and the package is carefully, and it's nice."
"It's the right model. It's a beautiful form pattern, it's a very small noise. Most of all, the charge battery is hard-wired, it's kind of hard to eat, it's got to adjust its head a few times into the electricity."
"Nice packages are unmoved, smoothed, lubricated buttons, mouse-cling, fast delivery, genuine cargo boxes."
It's a little unstable. The rest is good.
"Small, handy, and push buttons don't produce a sound that's comfortable, it's sensitive, it's long-term, it's hand-held, it's extremely well wrapped."
"For someone who likes cute little things like me, it's nice and it's nice and it's nice and it's nice and it's nice and it's nice and it's nice and it's nice and it's nice and it's nice and it's nice and it's good."
"Arts such as pictures, beautiful colors, medium hands, touch sensors, full boxes and stamps"
"Light mouse, quiet press, good compared to the price, every day takes four hours which since buying time hasn't been charged twice. The minus point is thin plastic, so the red light passes through the eye, and it doesn't get aestheticized."
"Rats use smoothness, no sound at all. Rats that I've tried are pretty good. They're fast, they're in Hanoi yesterday."
"The mouse is sensitive, it's soft, it's receiver gets good signals, it doesn't jerk off, it's a 159K generally, it's too good, it doesn't require more."
"Rats with the right hands, pretty good."
I don't know if the battery's sustainable.
"Rats use ok, no chat chat yet, bits of sour paper wipes"
"The product is exactly what the store advertises!! I agree, it's quiet, it doesn't make noise bother people!"
"The quick delivery of even though it's working, the beautiful color, the carefully packed mouse clicks, will support the next time."
"It's for kids, OK."
"Shop handles quick orders, fast delivery."
"The mouse is smooth, good, the price is right. OK, the mouse is smooth, good, the price is right. OK, the mouse is nice, the mouse is good, the price is good."
"Fast delivery, exactly sp. Packing neat, not broken."
"A little mouse noise is good for you, so buy it."
"It's a beautiful color mouse. It's very sensitive. It's a warrant, so I'm very relieved. Thank you, shop."
"The quality is good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good."
"Tiki now delivers super fast, good mouse quality, cute pink, your daughter loves it."
First bought at a shop that was very pleased with the quality of the product and how cskh of the shop
"The mouse is light, it's pretty sensitive, it doesn't make a sound."
It's a beautiful little mouse shop. You should buy it.
"The product's good, it's smooth, it's fast, it looks pretty good to me."

It's a nice color. Rats like it.
"Fast delivery, quality's pretty good, battery's pretty convenient."
"It's a nice click, the mouse is very sensitive."

That's great.
Super-Advanced Color Mouse
Quick delivery.
Okay.
So cuteee
Okay.
"It's okay, but the second day it doesn't feel so sensitive, sometimes it's two clicks, I don't know if it's enough to charge the battery, but it's okay to have the price of the store delivered to you black."
"The on/off button is higher than the base part, although very little but sd still has the feeling of trepidation"
It's not sustainable. We've had to change the batteries for a few months.
We've got it. We've got it. We've got it.
"Roses are very pretty, very soft clicks, but they're not compatible, they've got low-stiny labs, they've got to buy rats for mac."
"Dropping the mouse for about two minutes means losing the connection to the open source to connect, the battery's too weak."
Picky mouse light selects the table surface
"Rats aren't very sensitive, delivery."
"It's a bad quality. The battery's only got about two days, nodes, it's kind of annoying."
1 / not to use the time to move the mouse is to be paused as if the battery had run out.
The pick-up's been opened.
"If you wait to test it, you'll know what the quality is."
"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no."

"On the left is just bought from the shop, which on the right, buys one at the beginning of the year, buys one not to pick it up, it's M220 silent, it's the same size."
The delivery Shop is too fast to be set at 8-9 p.m. and tomorrow morning it's almost 10:00 in the morning.
"The item official should be very carefully packed, delivered at the right time, right color. Click a mouse test, do not make any noise, do not use it yet, and don't know if it's sensitive."
"It's not a bad name, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good."

"The mouse moves and clicks with no noise, the battery is attached."
"Sentimental, light, OK."
"Rats use it well, borrowed it."
"Mouse uses ok, very sensitive, quiet, not noise when clicking, but it looks like the beacon is broken, turn on ON to run normally but the lights are not lit"
"The good color, the quick delivery, has bought more than that, unfortunately the electronic bill has not yet been sent without knowing how to relate to the seller to ask,"
"Sensitive rats don't make noise, deliver on time, package them carefully, and label them easily broken, and approve of Tiki Trading's transport."
I've got the wrong sarcophagus in the U.S.R.U.S.A.

"The product is fake, Saigon is broken for a few months, the mouse is sliced when moving."
"It's got lights on it, but it's got lights on it. If I don't have lights on it, I don't buy them. If I don't have lights on it, I don't buy them."
"I don't want to talk about product quality because I can't use the product, but I want to respond here because of store's attitude."
"The delivery of the 22th of June, on the 27th day of the death, no mouse control on the screen, even if web is re-mounted, replaces new batteries, restart window several times."
You need to pick now 2/2 hours like you should check it first.
"The mouse is fine, the paint is nice, it's smooth, it's soft, it's down, there's a bit of noise, and the person with the big hands should think it over, because using little mice versus hands is going to make a lot of noise, and it's not going to make a lot of noise, but it's going to feel a little bit small."
"I got bought wrong, so I want to redo it."
"For a long time, rats are not very smooth, but rats are long at risk when they're used for details and rats are dying."
"The delivery is more than an hour late, no quality."
"Shop's got innovative support, but it's still his old mistake."
"The white mouse is beautiful, the delivery is from TPHCM, so it's a little long, I hope it's sustainable, and the A175 has a mouse click, so I have to buy this new one."
"Once a week, infrared eyes don't work."
"We started off with OK, pretty smooth, we didn't hear any clicks, but now we're broken, and we're using it well, and it's not going to work."
"Press the quiet key, but when you need to lift the mouse up and drop it, you're going to have the lid up."
"Let me ask you about the warranty, I don't have a full year's worth of stars."
"Put the battery in half a second, turn it off, the product's not working."
It's beautiful. It's nice. It's nice.

The product is loose and uncertain.
A quick delivery of beautiful mice can only be further evaluated
"The mouse won't last a month, and it's broken even though it's very popular to use it."
The rat's fine. The delivery guy's a little nervous.
There's a problem with the lights on.
"Quick delivery, good use"
Good at price range.
"It's a great price. It's a reasonable price. It's good water resistance, it's good form, it's good form, it's good form, it's good form, it's good form, it's good form, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good."

"The owner of the busy consulting shop, the clock has many functions, such as the description."
I don't know how to put it in English. I don't know how to write it. I don't even have to share it with you.
"Nice design, connected Wi-Fi, 4G with chpylay."
Okay.
Could not close temporary folder: %s
Pretty good.
"After one of your trials, I fell in love with this girl, even though there were two rats, and I still decided to take this baby. Click really well."
"Use your hands and hands gently, and it's worth the money."
"The lady rat must have moved smooth with both kinds of connections, and Bluetooth alone doesn't feel as late as the M590 used before."
"There's an AA battery inside. I'm on speed because there's no mouse use at the company, getting saved like thanks Tiki."
"The product has the right quality of the description, the package is solid, it's worth it, it's fast delivery P/s: there's no time for the photos, so we take the pictures up on the Internet."
"Soft clicks, smooth motions, accompanied by software when a computer mouse connection automatically downloads to change settings if necessary. There are two connections, Bluetooth and web. Cheap compared to quality."
"The product's very good, but the delivery was a little off-the-book, and I got paid in advance, but I didn't call, and we were all away, but when we checked the order, we found a delivery, and I didn't know that someone had taken it, and the next time you called someone who ordered it to help us, everything was okay."
"The order just returned to Tiki's side, still doesn't disappoint me for the smooth mouse quality, don't make noise."
"It's a long-term script, looking for white mouse that matches the keyboard that doubles the amount of keyboards that fit the little girls' hands, and it's actually women whose hands are small, and they use other mice that are very hard to reach, but this girl's hands are always on her hands, and she buys it on a company that the robot doesn't give apps to install the option for two buttons on the side, so it's like normal mouse."
Lazada recruits to work at home!!!! 100 people!!! 100!
"It's heavy, it's definitely soft, it's a little small for a man who's 6 feet tall."
Will return evaluation after use
"- It's just not good enough, it's good in range, it's good to have two connections, it's great to use an AA battery at a very impressive time."
It's been a long time since I've found the peace and quiet mouse.
"Right before your eyes. Okay, let's use it a little longer."
Good.
"As compared to the M220 that we're still using, we're holding it smoother, we're holding it quieter, we've got software to adjust the sensitivity of the mouse, so it's very satisfying."
"The color of y to the right hand, when the end says the mouse is a bit gnarly, but maybe a little bit later, okay, speed and precision are high, smooth, non-symble."
"There's a battery in the mouse, you can't make any noise, you should press the button and hold it for a while, otherwise the computer won't get the device."
"The perfect mouse, too much price, very low delay, great experience."
"The rats are light, they're good, sometimes they're not very sensitive because they're with MacOS, and it's much more sensitive to Windows, but it's a shame what doesn't work at the same time, even if there's two ways to connect."
"It's a nice thing to have the other side of the market, but it's a bit of a rush to buy, to use the right of the left."
Just got the package that looks good.
"The product uses quality, it's soft and it's quiet, it's got to be an office."

"I'm very pleased with the mouse product, using it very smoothly, and making no noise, and I've been using it for four months, and the experience is fine."

"I used to go through M590, M545... and some other silent mice of logo, but this time, getting MLI's really hard to understand when left mouse clicks still have clicks, right mouse is much smoother... no one else has it."
"- Unspecified product description (not sure what size you're picking and how many dollars) - tiki supports bad - products that don't allow orders in order: buying unhandled products, asking for slow feedback, and ""unsupported goods"" disappointed"
"Nice mouse, easy hand held, but smart Fleel wasn't impressed."
"I bought a 25K package at 10:00 a.m., but I got a delivery at 1445 p.m.? Shipper arrived at 9:50 to tell me he couldn't call me while I was still on the phone, normal waves and no delivery at 10:00, so I lost 25K and got a late delivery?"
"I'm really disappointed that my mouse is packed like this, and it's open without anaphylaxis, and it's too much, but I'm very upset, and I hope the store has more shock bags."
"The delivery box's got a little bit of a corner, and the inside product's fine, so far, I hope Tiki reviews the shipping of the goods, the serial number of boxes and on the product doesn't match."
"Haven't used yet, but it's well packed and fast delivered."
"The super-speed delivery on the next day, when it's urgent, and it's delivered early in the morning, but it's not delivered until 12 o'clock, and it's time to go to the store, and TikiNow is just good at collecting money."
"The product is fine, but Tiki has not yet supported the output of bills as requested. Please re-enroll the bill to email: ****"
God God God God God God God God God Goed God.
"The left-hand key error is not sensitive, the pressure is strong. I did the design, and it's very uncomfortable. On the bill, it's different than sp's serial number, so I can't preserve it."
"The mouse works well on both sides. It's narrow, not round like a bt. If you don't use it, it might be a little hard to handle."
"I've been buying mice for weeks where the mouse has been jerked off, and the mouse has not been so sensitive, it's also more disappointing: (((())(())"

The mouse using 2 months broke the button.
The anti-symbolic clicks are too loud.
"() Uncalculated delivery point very slowly. Sets the tiki2 hours from over 4:30 p.m. last night until 3:30 the next day, Shiper changes client time."
"() Unrecognizable estimates. Very disappointed about packing this time, the box is crushed + wet because of water, hoping that it won't affect the quality of the mouse."
"The good product in office segments, soft rubbers and sensors, well packed, but on products that don't have the warranty stamps and the warranty, recommend that Tiki know how to maintain the product when there's damage."
"In front of us, the left mouse click, right and the mouse scroll between the very small noise, the unspoiled seal integer, which does not see the warranty stamp, has one unsatisfactory point that the rubbers directly and the underwear seem to scratch as much as they used, but new ones."
"Pretty pleased with the pattern, which might be more appropriate for women because it's a little small. Fast delivery. It's a real silent (sometimes it doesn't feel good because it doesn't sound like clicking.) but it's very suitable for working at night that doesn't affect people)"
"It's the right color, it's not used long enough to know if it's okay, I hope it's as good as advertising."
"After a month of use, I found this product very good."
"The pattern is off the table, it's off the table, it's off the grid, it's off the grid, it's off the grid, it's off the grid, it's off the table, it's off the table, it's off the grid, it's off the grid, it's off the grid, it's off the grid, it's off the grid, it's under the table, it's under the table, it's under the CPU, it's on the back of the CPU, it's on the back of the CPU, it's a couple of pairs of batteries."
"Tiki delivers fast.It's lucky for me to have an sp package when I get it. OK, there's no sign of opening or being pressed. Like some other guest might get hit. Sp opens up in front of me. ok, nice mouse. I have the right question, buying the product that's defined as ""M31DT Plus"" but opening up the envelope only sees the product marked ""M331DDT"", about this question that sent a Tiki support unit two days ago but it's only getting feedback and then there's not an official response or anything else."
"I bought the m331 silent com for almost a month. the mouse was pretty good, the left was pretty smooth, no noise. I bought the blue one, and I got the right one, and I got the right one, and I got the right one, and I got the blue one."
"The late delivery, odder from May 28th until today, 5/6 before receiving the goods. The good quality product, the soft mouse click, the fit of the hand, the light click, the quality of the battery usage, the amount of time you're going to have to wait for more."
"It wasn't really negative. When I first bought it, it was good. The sound was almost completely silent, but the work I was doing with the mouse was kind of trying to screw it up."
"Rats are quite OK, but it's because they're M311 silent pluss, but they're giving M311 silents."
"The product's stable, it's stable, it's delivered quickly, just to four stars, because this product is no longer supported by Logotech, this is a product produced by the ship's company."
"The quick delivery, the package carefully, you shipper, you're extremely enthusiastic."
"I'm satisfied with the tiki delivery service, quickly, the beautiful form of goods, which are buyable even though they don't have the quality, but I don't understand why the delivery box is left before it reaches the customer's hand, even though they don't have the stamp on them."
"The quick delivery, the product works fine, the set, just check the boxes and the mice are different, don't we understand this place?"
"Look at the product on tiki, and I think it's got this much thicker blue, and yet I've kept it to use constant returnovers, comment so that tiki selects better and more authentic products."
"I don't have it yet, but I'm sure it'll be okay."
"It's nice, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's real, but S/N doesn't match the box, just like the rest of you have responded."
"The package was delivered quickly, and I ordered it the next morning. The new one hasn't been removed yet. However, I'm in a situation like many of you."
"I've just bought the third blue one, the red one from 2017 so far, it's still available, the second one in black one in 206, the third one in 205, the one in general, the one in a cup, the one in red one in a while, the one in a row, the one in a row, the one in a while, the one in a year, the red one in a while, it's still good."
I hope you'll stay in the middle. <i>Tiki delivers quickly and carefully.</i>
"It's true, silent, the click is very smooth, it's very similar to the Microsoft 3600, but this kid's test technology loses to Microsoft's blue tracker, and Microsoft's computer doesn't work, some of the surfaces, some of the papers don't feel very good."
"I bought it for 277K, because I used m280 to know it's a little small for my hand, but there's no better choice at the price."
"Advantage: - The smooth press does not produce noise, works at peace - the weight of the medium mouse is down: - The connection is broken if the connection comes from two obstacles up, even though the distance is not close (c. 70 cm)"
"It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay."
"Rats, as you would expect, tiny clicks and rolls only if in a very quiet room or letting rats close their ears to hear the sound, even though you put tiki now but the delivery is a bit slow."
The initial feeling is a little small for the male to use.
"It's not the package that you're showing, but it's a lot of tea and dirt on the bottom of the rubber part, the quality takes time to test it."
"Under the box there's a place to put something that's been removed, and there's only room left?"
Got a package... based on what's it look like... a new hand that hasn't been attached to the laptop.
"Sp is very nice, easy to use, especially red looks very lemon-looking?...and it's a little bit confusing when you open a box where the outside cover is as dusty as the new mouse but it's not, it's very embrace and it's easy to use it. at least the package should wipe over."
"The whole seal, tiki delivery is fast, the mouse is light but the little mouse grasps not close to the hand anyone who needs to use little, long-term mouse work is very hard"
"Use your hands hard, light, smooth, intelligent design reduces your hands in long use, but it's a little bad on the outside."
"Advantage: - Small, neat, handy. - Use of AA batteries so long the time spent using: - don't match the big hand person. - Sometimes the use is flat, tattered, lag.= = Fit to common intellectual needs, offices; don't play games that need to be handled quickly."
"I bought this one to replace the same one I bought two years ago, and I opened up that the cover had been cut, and the receiver head said it was Logotech, and it must have been because the shipment changed the company logo, and it's the same quality, but the serial numbers are different, and Tiki's trying to make sure the product is the same for everyone to feel safe."
"Quick delivery, nice mouse form, smooth click, however command responses are late"
"The delivery wasn't for two hours, but also on the day the box was cut, it was probably for the printing stamp, which was fine, which was smooth, which was appropriate for where it needed quiet evaluation sp: should be bought:)"
"You can pick your hand, you can use it, you can use it, you can use it, you can use it, you can use it, you can use it, you can use it."
"I've got the flux in a box, but I'm sure it's for the maintenance stamp hehe. <i>This mouse I used for your test, okay, so ms buys.</i> <i>I don't know.</i> <i>I don't know.</i> <i>I don't know.</i> <i>I don't know.</i> <i>I don't know.</i> <i>I don't know.</i> <i>I don't know.</i>I don't know.</i> <i>I don't know.</i>I don't know.</i> <i>I don't know.</i>I don't know.</i> <i>I don't know.</i> <i>I don't know.</i> <i>I don't know.</i>I don't know.</i> <i> <i> <i>I don't know.</i> <i>I don't know.</i> <i> <i> <i>I don't know.</i> <i> <i>I don't know.</i>I know.</i>I don't know.</i>I don't know.</i> <i>I know.</i> <i>I don't know.</i> <i> <i> <i> <i>I don't know.</i>I don't know.</i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i>I know.</i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i>I don't know.</i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i>I know.</i> <i> <i> <i>I know.</i>"
"The mouse is solid, the mouse is small and the mouse is slightly off balance, it's heavy in the handle, the other one's light, it's slightly uncomfortable compared to the central mouse in the middle."
"Tiki delivers fast, but the item she receives is taken out by a third of its shell, no longer a full box, should put a little doubt about its product condition, but open the box and use it for nothing."
"Tiki delivered very soon, set the morning evening already there, the sensuous Mouse, the knuckles. gouts"
"The product looks like it's a product, but I'm just wondering if the yellow light on the mouse's face is a matter of default or something."
"Okay: little noise and time of batteries, moving across the smooth surface. It's very smooth --> it's the same thing that's got 110 percent of tiki and hehe."
"It's a beautiful new form mouse in 2019, and it's not familiar at first after a rather sensibility session, but when you get a package that's extremely uncomfortable with the way it's packaged, you can see the mouse on the inside, you can't plug it in, you can't pack it, and next time, you can't take it, tiki."
"Breakn through, but found no fault."
"After about a year, there'll be no better response, and it'll be really good to buy a game."
"Rats use well, but the scroll button is a little loose."
"The product is stable, the battery is long-term. However, the error is that after changing the battery, or failing to control it, I and my colleagues buy a lot of this mouse once and have the same experience."
"The mouse is quite beautiful, same color as his Gshock. The mouse clicks almost without the sound. There is a weakness that the regular roll should roll pretty hard."
"The product's exactly what it's supposed to be, which is very, very good."
(Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) (Applause)
"I'm using a mouse that's eating the baby, rolling with the rubber on my thumb, so I have to buy a new one, and the producer generally should improve it so that the smell doesn't taste sexy, but I'm using it, okay, I don't fuck."
"It's only been two weeks, but the roll doesn't work, you have to hit the roll before you roll it."
"Nice, steady hand, but click still hears the sound but not thelent as some other gumlent mouse you once used, click right less noise than click fast delivery left, package well"
"The grip doesn't feel like M238, it doesn't feel like every person."
"I'm buying new mice because I need the non-symbolic kind of thing that's so good, it's so smooth, and it's almost impossible to produce clicks when it's used. Use it well with macbooks and windows. Need to improve: the scroll button seems to be not so smooth, but it's also used for a while."
"Takes good care of packages, same pattern in advertising, exact goods, efficient operations."
"The mouse click doesn't make any noise, but the rollback sounds pretty loud, so for four stars, you don't get used to the experience, so you don't get the first feeling like a mouse, you don't feel like a keyboard."
"The handle fits, the edge is rubber. It's no longer annoying by the tick sound."
"It's only been a week, it's okay to use a mouse, it's okay to move, but it's a little small for your hand, and it takes a long time to figure it out."
"I buy products from January, I use them to the present, and the mouse key has to press the machine, so I'm not allowed to receive them, so if I am, how does it work?"
"Wired mice, I hope to last a long time."
Why doesn't it work?
"Take it, press it, but mine doesn't know how or how."
"Tiki delivers on the right hand, packaged goods (with experience glued) when she has taken out the package and puts out the maintenance stamps) good worker's attitude, talking about the product: handles the hand fit, plastic on the side with the handles of the hand, press it nice, but a little bit disappointed in the baby's roll, click doesn't get any higher, you just use a mouse with a wire that's going through it's a little bit uncomfortable, generally worth the left to test."
"Hey, easy, nice hand, reasonable discount, so buy, if there's another button on the side, that's great."
Nice rat's pretty good. The delivery's a day slower than expected.
"I got the mouse baby during a short period of time, and on Wednesday afternoon on Thursday afternoon there was an employee calling for a check and delivery, and the package was nice and careful, but the product was still a bit small."
"Good quality, reasonable price."
"The whole sequence, the digiworld stamp, past the box, deliver it quickly, it's good. There's a point to improve it's a row name, it says 331 silent pluss, but the mouse has pluss."
"Shipper's attitude is inappropriate, friendly."
"The first use of wireless mouse by Lornetech is the M235, which buys it back at 01/2015 so far that the left mouse (the left mouse click is double). I've been working at night, so I don't know how long it takes me to buy this girl, but I don't know how hot it is because I'm afraid the smooth click will be less intense. Today, the click is better than expected. The mouse is still smoother, but the mouse is still smoother, but the mouse looks larger, maybe the first time I'm not used to see is not equal to M235."
"The mouse handles the hand, the sensitivity, and the clicks are small, and it's so new that you don't know what it's like, but the experience in the head feels really good."
"It's brand new, it's non-scramble, it's got a nice touch, it's got a soft click, it's still a big roll, it's worth the money, it's the only thing that's bothering you is that tiki delivers quite slowly, it's going to take five days for you to get it."
It's worth it.
"Good product, carefully packed, fastship"
The button is smooth. moves gently. The battery is long-term. Only one note is that it's easy to get stuck when it's pressed in the backpack.
"An observation after three months: good quality, medium-held mouse, and sure Pin using three months of continuous use begins to have drop/delay while very few sound silents are smooth, but the key is rolled back and forth as fast as rolling, and the delivery is fast and packaged very carefully, the conclusion is good enough to be bought unless you're a Christian."
"This Model has improved click button, smoother than old models, but sometimes it's lag, maybe because DPI is low."
"That's right, it's quite a shell."
Let me ask you how you got a mouse and you don't see a web head.
"It's getting fast, it's in the bag, it's smooth, it doesn't listen to noise, it's long-term because you're buying it."
"It's usually the old version, not Kreit Plus, the rubber upgrade."
"A nice mouse, using it well, but it does work when you click, you roll more clicks or whatever, and it seems like it's up to you, and your friend's mouse rolls away and doesn't feel as loud as a mouse."
"A soft button, no hard noise, no battery-saving lights."
"My fingers are a little long, so I don't know what they're used to, and my average finger is good."
"Before I buy this M331, I've got a lot of people who are reviewing, objective and most honest are people who measure 3* and 4. The mouse is very good."
"You know, it's sensitive, it's smooth, but for your hands, it's a little small!"
"The good product is within range, the normal use is fine, the game is still going to be a certain delay."
"It's okay, but there's something much slower than expected, but it's also been taken from tiki, and it's been temporarily understood."
"Right commercials, clicks that don't make noise, it suits you to do things that don't affect the people around you."
"The grip is solid, the button is soft, the mouse shape is unsymmetry, so the initial feeling is strange, it's used for a while, it's used to it, it's going to come back over time, it's going to be evaluated."
I don't know if it's a lot to change batteries because it's new to use.
"It's a little small for my hand, with batteries attached to it, but it's worth more than a week's worth of it."
"I've seen it in my hand. The mouse is gentle, sensitive, and special likes to press without a sound, but a little bit disliked that blue doesn't look like it.) Tiki was always fast before delivery and never did it make you feel hopeful."
I haven't received an electronic bill for this package.
"The delivery is fast, the delivery staff is friendly, the package's intact, there's no use."
"See how much you're talking about? It's okay. It's the original seal, it doesn't break the box -- the number on the box is different from the mouse. It's normal to see that seal doesn't change, because the rubber is slightly sticky, because obviously, the new mouse can't be used as some of you before."
"- The delivery was fast, set last night, packed the next afternoon. - The package is solid: Pretty good for the money (99k). Click the mouse without noise, hold the hand, touch it. - The warranty: Postage on the mouse edge, open the box, it's broken, I don't know later."
The public road is a little bad.
Don't worry about anyone working nights.
The purchase is Logotech M331 Federal Plus (in code on the firm's website). The result is 911.1. The output bill is 9102. The code is 9103. The code is 9104. > Code 8105.
"Advantage: - Buy during the discount should be a good price - soft click, blended colors - mouse-based batteries: - Use long-term numbness of hands. - Rolling is not very smooth."
"Tiki delivers it a little earlier on a one-day schedule, and as for the product, the mouse is short on hand, and you use it for a long time, but you don't feel tired, but you spend a little bit longer hoping for it to get softer and feel good about the product."
"Hold it, red looks nice, press no noise, delivers a little too long?"
"If you click, you don't hear click at first, and after about a month or so, you start hearing clicks, but it's very small."
"We're using a black one, so we're buying another one."
"Fast delivery, carefully packed packages. The mouse uses very smooth, easy connected to the computer without further installation of software support, acceptable & style material. Personal evaluations are good within the price range. Additional hint to tiki is that no print certificates and site maintenance is found."
It's okay. It's good. It's good to spend some time with a standard evaluation.
"The quality is pretty good. <i>From the buy of December 4th,2019, 7 months of use is fine.</i> <i>The new box is actually new.</i> <i>We haven't changed the battery yet.</i> <i>The battery.</i>"
"The log mouse is very good, because this is a maintenance product on the stamp, but the only way tiki pastes the seal doesn't make any sense is the mouse grip or the stamp can be torn so why do we feel safe using the product?"
"Mouse used very well, but delivered too slowly, set from October 27th to November 3, 2020 before receiving it."
"Mouse fits, does not render the absolute sound as is used by other samples, the original silicone material used to like but is hard to save."
"Use it at a price range, faster than the legendary fhulen mk that's using it, the Walder is also fast."
The mouse's DlP isn't good enough for the Mark.
"Good mouse, every sin that has seen the seal first, Tiki should withdraw iing suspectmejjj should not be cut first"
"The mouse holds very firm and smooth hand, the gentle redeemor, I please the quality of the product at this price"
"It's working, but it's not sustainable!"
Advantage - easy click - Sensibility Design - I like black but I don't sell:
"The back lid is hard, hard to break."
"The good product, like the title, is packed carefully, but the slow delivery takes a week after ordering the product. A small subtraction point, evaluates four."
"Buying black, selecting Tiki Trading for 269k, feeling satisfied when you use it, each without seeing a light light that tells you whether the mouse is being turned on or not, will follow and return to comment"
"Quick delivery, however, the seal on the outside of the shell, the silly thing is, Pulley has to stamp."
"Mouse receives a good signal, a soft and sensitive click. Mouse size is small, and it does not match someone with large or long hands. This is appropriate for mobile, office. This is not appropriate for ESA, gamer."
"To use it to see if it's okay, because we just got the package back."
"Em but DPI is too low so just to use the office, can't play the game."
I hope it's not as bad as the one your friend used to use last time.
"sp well, it's not familiar because you used to use two lines with Forward/Back edges"
"The mouse is smooth, non-scrapted; it is convenient to use it at night because it does not produce sounds as large as any other mouse. This may be due to the Macbook device, so it does not have much effect on the mouse when it slides up and down in text."
"The whole belt, the whole package, the quality of the product will be used to find out."
It's good. Scroll's a little loose left/right but there's no problem with that.
"Some reviews have been made after buying: - Fast delivery: afternoons April 4, 20, tiki announces 6 May May, 20 but mornings of May 5, 20 have received the good package - the solid package - the original package box is not unopened; there are stamps available; before reading notice some of you say that being opened and pasted, you're a little bit of uncertainty."
"The package is empty, not unsealed, like last time. Mouse is fine, it feels good, it's super fast, it's five days early, but it's still the M331 SILENT and not the new one as Tiki's description."
"I just bought it, so I'm fine, I don't know how long I've been on it."
"It's good, but it's a little small for my hand, so it's kind of annoying for my pinky."
"Use it normally, no complaints, no compliments, Tiki delivers the package carefully."
"Nice mouse, good use, good tiki delivery on time, I'd love to."
"Tiki packs close-size goods. This line is the gambit line, so while clicking the mouse is very smooth, it does not cause a big click. The relative sensitivity can respond to normal tasks. The only exception is sroll button is also bleating dramatically when scrolling."
"Take the package but do not know why the mouse has been removed from the can? There are DGW's antennas, but the antenna's out of the box. Mouse has been removed from the manufacturer's box, so I don't know if it's the main mouse, but I suggest that the sales unit have a more objective and trusting view of the customer, and I'm a regular buyer of Tiki's, but this time I realize that the uncomfortable product is the product itself?"
Hold the rubber pads like they're bottled up like their old ones.
"It's a beautiful form, quality waiting to find out."
"I've got sp, fast transport, the box's intact, but I don't see the warranty stamp."
Okay.
"The weight is light, it's smooth, you know, and if you have any support, it's five stars."
"It's small, it's relatively good, it's very soft. It's not going to be familiar at first, it's kind of weird. About a week from now, it's going to be very, very quiet."
"The delivery's been packaged, the product's been used, the battery's wrong, the battery's not rolling, so the power's hard to report."
"It's very shallow, it's not as deep as any of the others."
"The product information you're feeling is correct. Which one of your money rats, clicking almost quietly to the sound. It's still sensitive to putting it directly on the tabletop, holding your hand very firmly, making the delivery very fast, and not having an open line."
"The delivery is fast, each box is slightly distorted when received, possibly due to the transport process."
"When the buy broke, but it's been changed and used. Okay, thank you, tiki."
"I love the silent line of Logotech, but the mouse is not sensitive after using a few months."
Good use.
"It's fast, it's sustainable, it's not known because it's not used yet."
"I got the whole box mouse, but there's no warranty stamp."
"It's very small, it's okay, it's beautiful, it's within the price range."
"It's uncut, but it's a good quality."
Good.
I don't know if there's a warrant next time.
But I don't know why Tikinow was charged with another 30k worth of money.
"Quick delivery, however, rats sometimes have problems receiving signals."
"The first button feels good, the next one doesn't know."
"But for about a month and a half, the Roller gets super loud and annoying, and it still doesn't matter if it's three months old."
"Please, quick delivery, smooth use, no audio click, smooth, hand-to-hand."
"Love doesn't make noise for the people around you, it's about eight inches wide, and it's a short length between 20 centimeters."
"Mouse design holds hands firmly, when clicks don't make noise, I'm pretty happy about the product."
"The package service's too bad, Tiki's got a gift package, I understand that the gift package is that Tiki picked out a random color, but it's got to be consistent with the product, you know, you let the introductions include colorful packages."
"Nice mouse, hand-held, very smooth press, no noise."
"I wasn't very sensitive at first. Two days later, I was sensitive."
"Quick delivery, very well packed. Okay, the original mouse was as good as you'd like, for four, and one to see how the star works."
"The delivery is OK, the whole set of mice, which don't have any chimps that I like very much -- but the bottom one when I scratch them, I don't know if it's the mouse test of the company's mouse -- the quality of the company should not be discussed -- the package, the box only mice, the missing shock-proof steps, but also the electronic row, hoping for more attention."
"The product's right, but there's no warranty stamp, so it's down to 1 star."
"The sp quality to fuck with, without a keyboard, is easy to scratch the bottom of a mouse."
"Rats are sensitive, stable, hand-held design, and I'm quite pleased."
I've been using it for two years.
"It's been a month since we bought and used it, and it's good, no problem, it's all right, it's all right, it's all right, it's all right, it's all right, it's all right, it's all right, it's all right, it's all right to use graphics."
"Uses the mouse for nearly four months and is quite satisfied with the quality of the mouse, and even if there are several times when the mouse does not receive a signal to turn it off again, it is only normal to use it again."
"Rats are beautiful, they're smooth, but they're a little small for their hands, and when the mouse's chin goes up to move, it's not very easy to fall down the back part of the mouse."
"The stamps are disappointing, pasting them like that, and when I'm using them for a broken time, it's like losing my warranty, even if I get it by noon on December 4."
"A few of my estimates about the M331 product: fast delivery: I've set the TikiNworld from 17 December 12 which 19 hours have already been delivered, and the delivery staff are extremely friendly. - Close the package: the product box is intact, and there's no open ones."
The mouse is a bit sensitive. Sometimes the right mouse accidentally clicks
"Rows like descriptions good use for various types of surfaces, sensitive feeling satisfied"
"Mouse is stable, snazzy, which is suitable for soft press clicks"
The good product corresponds to the price of money. The package is sure.
"The package is exactly the same as the image. lt's soft, it's handy, it's good. If you hate what you've bought, you'll have a deep discount:"
"The roll isn't as good as the last one, but it's okay."
It's a flat tire. It's black.
"The Volvotech M331 wireless design is not as remarkable as the gnarly mouse, but it has its own elegant substance, which is very appropriate for the people of the office, the students, the class."
"Nice mouse. Uses steady, but playing games isn't really smooth. best within the price range."
Give me the cave now.
"The roll's not sensitive, the roll's a bit stiff."
Use non-verbal smoothness
"Evaluate after two weeks of use: - light mouse but hold-and-holding, comfortable embrace. - please about click without noise, sensitive click. - it's not good to roll non-smoking, toss, or to blame your mouse."
"Rats are pretty picky on the surface, so I don't feel comfortable."
"Rats use their favorite smoothness, but the mouse has no stamps on the inside."
"The price's okay. <i>Slow, soft.</i> <i>It's okay.</i> <i>It's not too colorful.</i> <i>It's okay.</i> <i>It's not too colorful.</i> <i>It's okay.</i> <i>It's not too colorful.</i> <i>It's not too colorful.</i> <i>It's okay.</i> <i>It's okay.</i> <i>It's okay.</i>It's okay.</i> <i>It's okay.</i>It's okay.</i> <i>It's okay.</i>It's okay.</i>It's okay.</i>It's okay.</i>It's okay.</i> <i> <i>It's okay.</i>It's okay.</i> <i> <i>It's okay.</i> <i> <i> <i>It's okay.</i> <i> <i> <i>It's okay.</i> <i> <i> <i> <i>It's okay.</i>It's okay.</i>It's okay.</i>It's okay.</i> <i> <i> <i>It's okay.</i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i>It's okay.</i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i>It's okay.</i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i>It's okay.</i> <i> <i> <i> <i>"
"Well used at a price range, very smooth, it takes more time to test the duability, because there's already one already."
Sp uses a week to make sure it's okay.
The product's been cut out.
"The battery said 12T, but it changed the battery yesterday."
"Touch it, hold it, hold it, hold it, hold it, hold it, hold it, hold it, hold it, hold it, hold it, hold it, hold it, hold it, hold it, hold it, hold it, hold it, hold it, hold it, hold it, hold it, hold it, hold it, hold it, hold it, hold it."
"Quick delivery, beautiful mouse, satisfied with Tiki Trading's service"
It's only been two days since we've evaluated the product. It's very smooth.
"It's nice, it's good."
good product
"Get the goods, pack up. Okay."
"The mouse was soft, the click was barely heard, the traffic was slow, placed from OECD, which only yesterday was received."
Vitruvius.
"Rats are fine, and at that price, rats are fine."
"The button's soft, the button's too smooth. It's not as smooth as the wheel of tens of thousands."
"The product's like advertising, waiting for the delivery a little while longer, quite satisfied."
That's it. That's it. That's it.
mouse ok
"Fast delivery, smooth clicks, slightly big roll buttons, but still fine."
"Quality rats, carefully packed, quick delivery."
"The mouse is smooth, press like."
Big hands need to get tired.
I can't even tell you how it works.
Maybe Slient doesn't like it by reputation.
Soft Press Mouse
"It's very good, it's just the hand, but it's not connected directly."
"Wrong purchase, hehe."
"Thank you, tiki."
I'll be back in the morning... and I'll be fine.
Okay.
Happy New Year!
Good Use
The delivery is less than a day late.

nothing to complain
"Nice color, sensitive contrast"
sp good
"The company's main goods, fast delivery, tiki the package carefully, will support the purchase on Tiki"
I think the product's pretty good.
"I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm happy, I'm fine."
It's okay.
"Good, sensitive."
"Slow delivery, good product."
"The mouse is very smooth, and I use it at night with no noise at all, but the red and the blue do not look very good."
Fine and good design.
It's not exactly what it's like to use it on macprosine.
"Rats are pretty good, handsy. No mistakes after three months of use."
"The mouse is smooth, clicking doesn't ring --> it's good to feel it's not too much to deliver more than 24 hours once you've ordered fast delivery."
"When I picked up the wrong red, but when I got it, I liked the red."
The package is very carefully packed
"It's quite comfortable (for better than MS 3500), working at night affects people."
Soft and sensitive mouse
Good use.
Mouse Use ok
How long do you think it's been?
"Use it smooth, sensitive, good."
"The mouse works well, moving smoothly on many surfaces, the press is smooth, the battery is long, but the roll button isn't smooth, the plastic material is a bit cheap."
"+ Good Mouse, light, no call + There are Unify Receiver convenient - No function Forward/Back"
"Nice, smooth, soft-footed mice with no sound at all when they click. But tikis these days, the quality's too bad to be wrinkled."
It's very good. It's very good.
It suits the price of the money.
"It's small, it's hand-held, it's sensitive, it's good at this price."
"I get quick products in a short time, the product's pretty good."
You're happy with the product!
Sp sd well
"The sensor, holding hand, very smooth, probably not making noise. Tiki packs carefully, delivers very quickly. There are some problems that when you buy (1111/11) you care about: - The name may have been unconventioned by Arkentech: it's on the home page to read the M331TDT Plus, but it's a link to the CGDVKMMTDTDT Plus, and Tiki for the first name of the first name M331TrmPrest Plus, which was then removed with the name on the box."
Okay.
Good.
Two Dragons Splipped the cave
"Good mouse, smooth hand, but when you get it, there's no official stamps."
"Small, hand-held design with no noise in it."
"The handle product fits with the big hand, without making a lot of noise when clicking the mouse, the hard, non-smoking mouse button, feels like this button on the mouse side of the stressoft"
It's a bit expensive.
"Rats use ok, quick delivery of nice packages, will continue to support."
"It's nice, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good."
"Nice, sensitive, right button to the bottom, gently."
"Code: OK silent: OK. First month is stable, then sometimes the cursor is dragged abnormally."
"The good product is good, the whole set, the nice color, and it's very good with this product."
"Use it ok, smooth, it's a silent line, each which is too soft to click into double clicks of 50 chaps."
It's cheap to buy it at the store in general.
"The price's a little rough, but the quality of the mouse is okay."
"Except the delivery wasn't exactly the time of the deal, and the mouse was fine."
"The supplier must have learned not to remove the box before, so his product is in the box, without a scratch on the bottom, and the mouse clicks are so strong, it doesn't take so much force, the sound is smooth, the normal working environment won't listen at all, the quiet evening will sound small, it's very buyable."
"The real product, the mouse is the right kind of silence, the click is almost impossible; the rubber on the mouse body is difficult to use."
"The package is intact, loading the log log level of the company check, customizing mouse function, mouse speed,... beautiful, compact design, smooth use of the mouse."
"We're wondering, there's no charge to the product."
"The product was well-used, but the delivery guy was upset when he wondered about the product that had already been opened in the box."
"A nice, sensitive, very soft mouse, with almost no noise, and a USB connection with it is a normal type, only a single device."
"The pressure is smooth and firm, the blue is nice, the overall satisfaction."
"Tiki delivers faster than expected a day. before the C.S. is so noisy, I decided to buy this girl."
"Very pleased, smooth, quiet click but the middle roll is not good yet call.Tiki delivers fast and packing very well."
"Take the whole package, the whole package, but there's no stamps on it."
"It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay. It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay."
"It's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, while it's delivered, it's a hole in the box."
"Today, tiki delivers more late than expected."
"The number of batteries is good, automatically shut off when you don't use - The mouse-sides are easy to cling to"
"When I open the box, it's pretty good, but when I look back, the light is in the middle, and the check on the back, it's scratching the body as if it's using the checkbox, and I'm putting M331 Schint Plus, and I'm sending it to M331rdy, but it's kind of selling it."
"The operation was good, fast, sensitive. The design was appropriate for use. The neat one was nice, pretty."
"I used to use 221, which is a slightly uncomfortable, sticky button, but you M331, which feels like a good grip and a firm grip, which is very careful, uncut, which is a DGW product, but I don't know where it's going to be pasted when it needs to be stored."
"Get the red 'cause it's right now that only this two-hourship and Tiki Trading. Get it after ordering it for just over an hour. The package is completely packaged without a scratch. The product is brandish and super smooth, it's not familiar because there's no clicking on it, it's always cool to buy something like this on Tiki."
"Fast delivery, carefully packed, very pleased with the quality of the product, the rat's name is Enhardt Plus..."
"Rats are so quiet and quiet, they don't make sounds when they're used, batteries have to be used to find out."
"You know, it's pretty nice to use it well, if there's a problem, I'll make a comment later."
"The mouse is pretty nice even though there's some unfinished points, and Saigon is smooth, and it doesn't make any noise, it's too good at the price."
"Already bought M331 times 2. The correct mouse, quiet, working at night does not affect other people; however, the rubber in the prostruding part of the palm of the hand will be aging after about a year's use. This can be considered M330 to prevent this condition (the entire part of the coal is made of solid plastic)."
"Rats are beautiful, they can fit in, they're given a battery, they're extremely smooth and they don't make any noise."
I've been experiencing it for two days. <i>The mouse seems to like it.</i> <i>Tiki's packed properly.</i> <i>Thank Tiki.</i> <i>I'm sorry.</i> <i>I'm so sorry.</i> <i>I'm so sorry.</i> <i>I'm so sorry.</i> <i>I'm so sorry.</i> <i>I'm so sorry.</i> <i>I'm so sorry.</i> <i>I'm so sorry.</i>
"Well, as long as it lasts, and as quiet as advertised, Logotech is okay."
"See, tiki delivers fast, dark, next morning, thanks tiki!"
"The quality of Logotech is known in the world for a long time. Mouse is made of good plastic material, rubber pads with anti-smoking flowers, which are very well-funded. Mouse is neither too small nor too big for men nor women, although you're an office worker, students often speak on laptops or video games, especially at night, because it's almost impossible for their customers to use mice."
The mouse uses quite well. However the blue is not the same as the image. The color is slightly light. Mouse is smooth and k is causing noise.
"Rats are good, sensitive, battery-saving."
"I've got the product in twisted boxes, and you say the delivery is already there, and the plastic shell is on the left side, and the mouse is beeped."
"It's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good."
"Rats are fine, sounds are good, but sometimes not very sensitive."
"It's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's no noise, it's fast delivery, it's good stuff."
"Rats are like pictures, they're quiet, they're not loud, but they don't fit with big hands because they're pretty small."
"The product doesn't stick stamps, so when it's going to be in need of maintenance, it's going to take support from Tiki, because if it's possible that I'm going to send security guards at Logotech, they don't support sp without stamps."
"The mouse moves smoothly, moving all over the surface, clicking the silent mouse, as well as the ones that work in the office environment."
"I don't know what's going on, but when you get the package that's in the box and the base has already been used. Thinks that the battery should still be used for three days to see the results. When compared with a similar subset of your colleagues on the shoppe, there's the paste part and I don't. The mouse button is overscrambled to the left. Mouse is too small for the hand, DPI isn't as smooth as the given. The serial number I don't really match it because I think it's a shock that I have to buy or use it. Requires that there's a solution as soon."
"If there's a problem, what does Tiki have to worry about? 0 understand why some of you value one star for the right reason zero."
I bought three of them and found them to be easy and easy to use and quiet to work at night.
"Rats use well, press smooth, feel good about products"
"There's been a scratch of the base, and it's the M331-pound mouse that's been beeping, but this mouse is typing, and the battery's pretty loose."
"Rats use OK, smooth hands."
"Fine, nice, light, and sensitive, very nice blue."
"The mouse goes with the battery. so before the delivery, the box shell will go off before but this problem. OK, I feel better when you're first. beautiful mouse looks, beautiful plastic."
"Packing the paper carefully with paper in order to fight the dam, the new product is uncut, feeling that neither use nor hand makes a sound like a normal mouse, the mouse border contact with the palms of the soft rubber is quite comfortable. Read other observations but when the merchandise is quite favorable, about how long it takes to test!"
"The delivery is extremely fast for less than 24 hours. The new mouse is smooth, the right button is soft. The scroll button is smooth, the scroll button is sound but is not loud, since this button is rarely accepted."
"This product that I bought for the second time, for the first time I bought for 7-8 months failed, and this time I bought for 30 minutes, and I decided to spend a few more hours trying to see if it's still going to happen, but the harder it's going to be to use it."
"The mouse is smaller than the average hand - big, as big as midtimi is fine: the left hand handle is fine; the noise level is fine; the noise level is fine in the master room before hearing clicks. The scroll does not roll as round as a wheel; it seems weird to use it; but glides, and some webs feel slight after the scrolling of the page - not clearly because the web or the mouse; DPI / the speed is not very smooth - still following the laptop’s laptop."
"The number S/N on the box shell, on the mouse and on Reiver does not match; the mouse leg has been badly scratched. Please suggest that Tiki check and get the earliest feedback."
"The mouse moves smoothly and the queen, and the mouse design is comfortable, and the color and the style is neat, and I think this mouse is more suitable for women's hands than for men, and I order that Tiki Trading's, with digiworld stamps on the box, and I'm perfectly satisfied with this product."
"The quality is good, because clicks don't play sounds can be difficult to detect already clicked, haha."
"It doesn't make any sound. The product's cursed, seal and Digiworld. The quality is long-term, but it's quite satisfying. The delivery is fast."
"It's a good quality, a little smoother, a little smoother."
"When I first received the product, the mouse was signaled that when the click was broken and it was very bad, although the three canisters were still in balance. At first I thought that the mouse was made or the feeling was wrong, but after checking about three mice of my co-workers, the mouse was a mistake."
"Nice looks, good quality, carefully packed tiki."
- The mouse is light and sensitive. - The battery only uses one pill. The battery seems to be fast.
"So when it comes to the sale unit (Tiki Trading), answer:--Why was the box of the product being cut/dried?--Why was there no preservative stamps on the product?"
"The mouse clicks very smoothly, but you roll up and down and it's a bit loud and use it."
"Hand over the cave, coral ben, dep, hand orange."
Use ok ikjs mkjnjkshkkkjddhkdhkddhkkjhequj
"The serial numbers and box shells aren't the same, did you hear review opening up boxes of digiworld stamps that you saw past the box?"
"I used to use M221, but after two years of not being sensitive, I decided to switch to M331, Tiki delivers very quickly because I used Tikinow."
"It's not like we're talking about sex, it's like we're trying to figure out what we're talking about."
"- The mouse was very good for the first four months but then suddenly it didn't work again! - The night before we used bt, the next morning the lights went up but the mice didn't move. - I bought two, one in Tiki and one in ***, a week apart, and the two that were broken a week apart!"
"I've just opened the box today and I've been using for about two hours, and at first, the mouse uses normal, and it's pretty smooth, but after two hours, it's not the same thing as a mouse, it's the size of a mouse, it's not the size of a mouse, it's the size of a mouse, it's the size of a mouse, and it's the amount that I think is bad and it shouldn't happen."
"Rats are smooth, they don't make noise."
"Fine rats, a little hard, but don't make sound."
"Before the time of the sale at tiki, it's been very, very pleased about the package and the delivery of Tiki, but about three of the most recent forms appear to be unacceptable, and this time I've ordered this loghog, which I'm late for even though I'm calling twice. If I deliver the package into the package box, the package will fit the size of the package, which makes the package look terrible, and the box will be torn, and this package will actually be unacceptable. If the security stamp is on the mouse, then the mouse holds it, the mouse should be very easy to save the battery, and save the battery."
"Rats are sensitive, quiet as no, but slightly heavy. Sees review is more than m330 and responds very well so choose m331. Very pleased. seal raw, distributed by DW."
"Use oke but always include the mouse table, or it will be relatively lag."
"Good, good, good, good, right for price."
"It's pretty smooth, at first looking at the tiki box delivered by the wrong silent, but check the serial number on the web is still out of silent pluss."
"It's perfect, it's very smooth, it's very soft on the side and it's comfortable on the side."
"Tiki's two-hour fast delivery is already received, and Logotech's product is secure in quality. Mouse holds hands, flies for hours, silent mode doesn't have a big addition. Mouse already has a battery provided by the company. In accordance with the DOSign environment work, improves the operations along the side using pad and the drawing board."
"it's a nice treat in roughing out of prayer, eating batty, like either why trouble"
"Got the product after an hour of ordering (Q7, HCM), I believe using this Voltatech company for 10 years."
"I bought a mouse on May 4th, 20th, to May, 2021, and the mouse was broken, specifically the left mouse at the time of no reception."
"Tiki asked me why my product buys a DGW stamp, so how's it going to go with the product that's got stamps and stamps, see what it's like to have a product without stamps?"
"I've bought the red one, now this blue one."
"We bought it once in a while, we used it very well. <i>It's okay to click quietly.</i> <i>Just buy the dealer Tiki Trading.</i> <i>It's good to communicate quickly with quality.</i>"
This is the best spirn at the price of Logotech.
There's a new mouse but the bottom one's been scratched a lot.
"Quick delivery, nice mouse, no!"
"Rats I've tried, I've seen new and no scratch."
"If asked if any brands were offered for computer parts, especially wireless mice, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend Logotech."
"This one I bought for my sister, had to call the click sound as tiny as the whisperer. It's extremely appropriate for anyone who needs the quietness and doesn't bother others. The grip feels pretty big and smooth, because it's got a thin rubber on either side, so it's kind of slippery."
The whole box doesn't have pulleys like the previous ratings.
"The mouse is on one side of the left. Even though it's changed to the second one, it's still as bad as it gets, although it's a little bit better."
"Worth it, holding tight, sensitive and smooth."
"This mouse is like a guy who says, ""I don't like to hear clicks that are a little bit noisy, but it's also a little bit uncomfortable, so this one just got her choice."
"Fast delivery, which was available in an hour, but when we checked the product was already open, the mouse base was marked a scratch, and the situation wasn't completely new, but the product was fine and smooth, so I got it, and it's not very comfortable."
"Tiki delivers fast, packed carefully."
"The delivery was expected earlier than time should not have been at home to receive the first delivery, so it confirmed the time the delivery was more accurate."
"The super quiet mouse doesn't make a click if it's not in the quiet room, there's no sound, it's right, it's a little bit big for the girl, but it's okay."
"Quick delivery, delivery a day earlier than expected, when you get the rest of the box, you stamp it out, and you make sure it's really smooth, it's not like a normal mouse stream."
"The delivery is on schedule. The main product, it's good."
"See, some of you are talking like this, but I feel very, very, very good, even though it's not total silence, it's less unpleasant than other kinds of things."
"I've been using this product for about two months, and I've been using red, and I've read review that it's easy to get dirty, but I don't think it's a little bit dirty, but I've got to look at it."
"There's a sound of a mouse click, but it's not that big, it's not that quiet, it's a little quiet, it's a long time, it's a little low, I don't know if the battery's weak or if there's not much demand, or if there's not a lot of precision in it, it's a good thing to buy it for 8 out of 10 points."
"I've been buying in tiki, every time I get it early, about 1,2 days, and I've got it, and I've got it, and I've got it, I've got it, I've got it, I've got it, I've got it, I've got it, I've got it, I've got it, I've got it, I've got it, I've got it, I've got it, I've got it, I've got it, I've got it, I've got it, I've got it, I've got it, I've got it, I've got it, I've got it, I've got it've got it, I've got it, I've got it, I've got it, I've got it, I've got it, I've got it, I've got it, I've got it've got it."
"Shipper TIVI doesn't deliver, but it's on its own to update the order of delivery."
"The rubber pads aren't scratched like so many reviews, and we generally appreciate this M331 mlent log using smooth mouse clicks."
"No Bluetooth mode, no tiki output line, no support for warranty, exchange, shared information makes sense of the specifics. Disillusionment."
"I don't have a delivery ticket, and I don't have any insurance, and I think I can buy a good mouse, and I'm bored."
"- Set a weekly delivery schedule on April 6, the same day I check unregistered and packaged, and I have to send in a new package application and send it to April 16th, when I'm going to use an unrecognizable signal head."
"It's a very old GTOtech model 185 that's okay, but this M331 is way ahead of itself. It's fast, it's fast, it's nice, there's also a place for your USP head."
The design product is very smooth for use. Mouse. m uses whole with K360 keyboards for ipad pro of m. Very good
"The package is exactly the same as the description, the mouse clicks are soft, the noise is not working at night, and it's just a little too small for the guy's hand, if his daughter likes it. M likes to hold the mouse a little bit, and everything's fine."
The left mouse button is not sensitive.
"The mouse handles the touch, the sound is light when you click, the delivery is super fast!"
"This is one of the most sustainable mice I've ever used, bought since the middle of last year, which is not gone yet, although I'm making graphics, and I'm playing mouse games, and it's pretty straight. Click listening, except for men with big hands, if you've ever used large mice, it's not going to be familiar, but it's not going to be significant."
"I must say, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes."
"The beautiful product. The package is packed carefully. Saigon this week is smooth. The click is soft, it's light, it's often not used to or hit the wrong button."
"where the left mouse scroll has been scratched, even though it is not yet used, the left mouse button has been sunk in comparison to the right, unaware of the exchange of the old row, which will link the operator to reflect"
"Now buy this M331 thing you've got to know, click on a tiny stick, and there's a wheelchair that's still a bit loud, it's a little sensitive, it's a good use, it's a good idea to design something like this."
It's very good to use it. It's a two-day delivery.
"Bull batteries. Light, steady hand clicks, don't make a sound."
"Fast delivery, right color, smooth mouse."
"About Tiki: Buying on Tiki is always secure at one point, the main product, the product quality is always guaranteed."
"The left mouse is broken. The left mouse is now using non-clickable mouse, marble and right mouse are functioning normally, changing the battery, booting the machine, replacing the other USB port, and switching the other mouse into the OK click."
"Fast delivery, well packed, good quality, more product from the shop to support it."
"The good, stable product at such a price, I've bought it in a lot of places and nowhere is it that I'm as pleased as this place is."
"I've seen a lot of you wonder why the rats are out, and I've also bought them, and I've seen that the mice are out there putting on the stamps for the product, and if you're worried about the quality of the product, it's best to choose Tiki Trading for peace of mind, and I've never been disappointed in Tiki."
"Even though it's the center of the city that tiki will deliver fast, but not so fast, it's less than 15 minutes since she's put in line as a description, good use, good money, 10 points for tikinow"
"I buy from tiki boysding, so that the product's name is 331 silent pluss but gets silent, not pluss. the product is intact, but the underside is too much scratch, I don't know why."
"Good mouse, soft press doesn't make noise from npp Tiki Trading."
"The original mouse set, check the company's main line, nice and use the sensor, press almost no click."
"Fast delivery, good mouse, very strong click, with extra pads wrapped around it should be much more comfortable with it, I don't know if it's sustainable, but the initial feeling is good."
"The first feeling is that you feel like it, you hold it, each click doesn't make a sound, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay?"
"Freeship should be bought at tikinow for 28xk, raw belts working well. However, since you are a silence mouse, therefore a slightly short key trip. The feedback on mouse clicks is not as good as any other normal mouse."
smooth move. Light press. Nice style.
"There's always a good price to buy, and the whole box has a battery in it, and it's a good black one, and it's good to buy it, and it's good to get it, and it's good to hear it, and it's good to hear it, and it's worth five stars."
"Buying on Tiki at T11020, after 1.5 months of use, sees the product with signs of a signal failure, specifically the mouse will sometimes be torn apart as the user wants. This doesn't happen very often, but it's enough to upset the user. The information to people for reference when buying the M331 M31 Tert Mouse"

"Tiki had a newspaper on August 28 that she was going to get it back because of the web gate, not because of rats, but because she didn't get it today."
"Softer, smoother than M220"
"Rats, quieter than M221, form holding hands, are more suitable than men. Check the code on the main company website. S/N is out of boxes and in mice, but the firm explains it as normal. Check the box code is not correct but the code in the main mouse; Tiki delivers it very quickly (T2) but delivers it in the morning T6; finally, the GHPtech mouse is extremely beautiful."
"The product went wrong, the warranty changed the new one from New Year's, and now the roll key's out of shape, and it's not going to roll."
"I just got the package today, and when I peeled out the box, I found that the box was boxed, and at the bottom of the mouse, and I had a lot of snag on it, and it was a sign that it was old, and I really liked Tiki, but I didn't like it this time."
"It's a good product, but it's M331 silent, not Plus, which exists."
"If it's new, why is there a problem like this? tiki tells me how to change the package."
"My hands are so big, I don't know how small the mouse is."
"Good mouse, sensitive, very smooth hand, very quiet, very quiet clicks no noise at all. <i>In case you're working at night/in your room, helping others.</i> <i>The mouse is very strong.</i> <i>This is the third mouse I've bought, because the last two are so good friends.</i> <i>Please take it all to me.</i> <i>This is the third mouse.</i> <i>It's the third mouse.</i> <i>This is the third one I bought.</i> <i> <i>This is the third mouse.</i> <i> <i>This is the third one.</i>"
"The package closes the whole package, doesn't see any fake signatures, or has removed the size of the average man's average hand. The color in the black is not as good as the black of M221. If this child does not find the KIt Plus anywhere on the mouse, this may be just a normal M331 version of the M331 and not as much money, the actual noise is not less than M221. If compared to this child is equal to Azzo Eagle, then the quality is only greater, but Azzo Eagle has far lower cost than the general amount of money, but also can't be accepted."
The product is fast and well packed.
"It's good for anyone with a basic left mouse need, scrolling down the page. Nice mouse click. Two siders design good friction in the handle, but it's difficult to use the toilet during later use."
"With relatively reasonable prices, the quality of the product is really good, and when we use it without making noise, saving batteries, and it's easy to take away, and in terms of restrictions, we don't see it, and the quality of the product needs time to look at it; in general, it's a very buyable product."
"The original product is seal, but in the box there's no warranty or any other documents related to the product other than a torn cement paper wrapped in mice."
"This is the second mouse that buys it for your friend, buys it for you, buys it twice, buys it for you, buys it, buys it, buys it, buys it, buys it, buys it."
"Very much like this smog. The hand-held mouse fits, a good version of M221. Mouse gets an extra battery, it's all right. Everything's fine. In the long run, you have to wait a little bit longer to find out. If someone likes M221, they should buy M331 for upgrade when the old mouse breaks down."
"I found that the sales unit was Tiki Trading, so I bought it because I trusted Tiki to check the product thoroughly, and I can't believe that after I bought it for three months, the mouse was not sensitive, and I asked Tiki to take it out, and then the next two weeks, the mouse won't be able to move."
"It's cool, it's cool, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good."
"The shipper delivers early on a friendly day, and at the same tiki, the other store is 30K cheaper, but it's more likely to buy the tiki checkding box itself."
"The company's main product should be off-line, but the package quality is too bad, and I've bought pretty much online, but I've never seen a package like this, just put the whole product in a thin cover with no more cover, and the product is still available, but the life span of the material is secure, and Tiki needs to look at this and improve it."
"I've been using it for a while, but I'm still very sensitive, and I haven't changed the batteries, compared to the price, quality."
"The quick delivery, the whole seal, unfortunately the box shell is for long periods of storage so the right mouse button is lowering the right mouse button than the left button!"
"Rats are good, they don't produce sound, they hold hands together, they get discounted."
I used three-and-a-half of the wireless mouse (only used for basic office tasks) but this is the one that I'm most pleased with.
"The mouse is smooth, but short and small, and the hand is not too big for the person."
"Nice, light, quality, quick delivery, nice package."
"Use ok, designed with curved curves, round tips, and close palm hugs, helping the user to reduce the pain of the wrists and fingers. The mouse sides have small triangles that are stacked together to create a grip that helps the user not to be lubricated during the use"
"The quiet key, no sound, no dress, however unremarkable, about the 3/5 test point (I don't know what it is but I mean the precision of the mouse)."
"I bought the standard delivery so there wasn't any charge, when theship about mouse is carefully wrapped, stamped, in its form not a scratch, yes to what the product was introduced I also checked this mouse code on logs and is real, and now the mouse is very high for no lag or jerking the mouse."
"The left key is OK, but the scroll cannot roll. Press with the mouse roll when you open the web is also very hard. Error product, offer to change yourself another sp."
"Fast delivery, secure boxes, only on products that don't see fake stamps or stamps, so it's a little nervous, but it's generally okay."
"That's okay. <i>Small color.</i> <i>If tone with a lower color like a Bluetooth mouse, it's better.</i> <i>The left mouse button + right mouse button is light.</i> <i>So the mouse roll is a little rough.</i> <i>The other one's great.</i> <i>The left mouse button has a little twist.</i> <i>The left mouse roll.</i> <i>The other one's great.</i> <i>The other one's great.</i>"
The product that buys four months suddenly doesn't work for left mouse anymore:
"I got the goods very quickly and check when I was opening things up everything was okay, but in the process the mouse was unstable, at the time the mouse was not there, and I didn't know if it was the mouse or the battery was in the mouse."
"These are some of my feelings about the product as well as the shop: the store is incredibly fast, incredibly fast, for these 10 pieces."
"In the office, there's no mouse clicks, but at home there's still small clicks, but it's generally very nice."
"Soft, smooth, beautiful, good-handed rats don't get tired."
"When delivery is delivered, you see the mouse key that has to be pouted, you have to press down with your hand and press the weight: (.. the soft mouse runs well on windows 10, but slightly lagging on the macprosus.) Unknown as to which dpi is low or why, so stop using it as a mouse on Cty, and find another one for the macbook."
"My old mouse (small, USB wire, 99k, bought at an unrenamed bronze store) started showing two weeks: jumping around on the screen, double-clicking, while I only wanted to click alone, which in general started to make me nervous and stressful when I was doing the basic and simple things."
"Tiki delivers quickly and carefully packed goods, and Lenotech's main feeling of holding hands is very comfortable using them."
"Quick delivery, real product."
"It's a nice color, so it's safe, it's worth 100k Momo, so it's less than 200k, it's a super-speed delivery."
"The mouse has been used for over a week without any problems, the mouse clicks light. The daily code job is a lot less painful."
"The beautiful pattern, catch the eye, then use it very gently, and it's very smooth. The mouse works very smooth, the sound when clicks very light, doesn't make any noise."
"After reading a lot of reviews from our previous clients, I put one of my girls on use, and it's a lot of rat shit, although it's kind of hard to figure out where everything's going to be."
"The mouse has to press very smoothly -- the short, smooth, left mouse has a small beep because of a longer click, although it does have a bit more gumlent than your old mouse, but it still sounds small, but at the same price it's okay."
"Tiki should check out the user-sharing stamping, past-the-line stamping, what's next time there's a warranty?"
"Use ok mn. plug receiver directly into the laptop or over hub web all receive, we use it with macos. the mouse feet are pretty good, moving on the wooden surface but should encourage still have mice."
"The delivery was fast, yesterday's setting was delivered."
"Take a long time, from mouse, key, from average to advanced, this one is making too much of a disappointment.1.The battery change is not going away.The reaction is slow - probably because the signal is slow, and then it changes to the M331, which is much smoother."
"Rats use it very much, and there's no mention of mice, and there's a place where they can put their thumb right in the machine, and at first they have to take a long time to pick it up, and I thought the mouse had failed, but then they were shown very well."
"This is the first time I've ever bought in tiki, so it's kind of scary, but everything changed when I bought this M331 wireless mouse."
"Okay, use your ears, I've got blue, I've got red because I'm so good at it."
Hu is worth real money? Click or roll the mouse does not have a sound at all.
"The whole mouse is quite comfortable, and the left mouse and right mouse are quite smooth, and it doesn't produce sound when you click it, but the mouse’s part is quite gropy, which makes it a bit uncomfortable to use, which is kind of pouty, for which the cost of 289k is worth of a mouse."
Mouse handles fit in hand. The feeling of the use is very much. Mouse has a silent feature and no longer hear clicks when clicking. Tiki is packed carefully.
"The switch's too good, but the scroller's not as good as the M325, or the M595."
"The mouse clicks quietly, the voice is very small, but somehow his wheelchair feels extremely loose, when he puts his hand on the roll or when the roll often releases a small but uncomfortable break, and it is not clear whether each mouse is so or any other."
"The whole box rat doesn't smell like rubber, hehe, but it's okay, press nothing, run on the glass."
"The click is light, it hears clicks, it's silent in the middle. It's a pity it's a little bigger."
The mouse that just ran out of warranty for a few months broke the left key.
The mouse has been good for months. It's not likely it's because of the office style.
Quick delivery.
"It's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good."
"It's not until Monday morning, we'll see it."
"It's a little light to buy it, but it's not easy to use your time, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good."
It's cheap.
"I'm sorry, why the S/N number on the mouse body and the different boxes?"
"The new product, the whole box, uses it very well, it feels certain, it's going to cost about 284K. It's going to take more experience.5 for Shop."
"Looking sharp, the Mouse uses light, press good. Tiki's quick delivery package is very much interested in the nine o'clock in the morning that he ordered the package that less than 12 o'clock had been delivered."
"Nice mouse, perfect good. Click without a voice. It's not familiar at first, it's a little uncomfortable, but it's about 15 minutes old. The mouse roll is soft, it's easy to roll."
"- The good work of Logotech, we don't need to use the underwear, but we're still sensitive. - Click the mouse, there's no sound. - Tiki delivers fast, package well."
"I intend to buy from Tiki Trading because I believe it's more than a shop. This mouse is used by my IT company recommend for high school employees, it's not the best but it's considered good on the shelf."
"A quick delivery of goods, smooth, handsy, undisputed mouse clicks, very convenient for working nights that don't bother others to sleep."
I don't know what to do with the machine.
"This product uses very well, generally noise almost none, but most importantly, the feeling that the mouse is so good, the left mouse and the right mouse press very slightly, does not cause each hand after printing time! very pleased!"
"It's only been months that the condoms around it are dirty, even though they don't have a lot of sweat on their hands."
Tiki's a terrible support.
"The mouse is good, I've got a nice red. Click kno, there's a GP battery with me, it's a regular battery, but I haven't seen the battery in months, and this mouse has saved the battery."
"Okay, nice, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good."
"The mouse is going to be OK, it's going to be very smooth, click is going to sound very small and it's still going to keep the click like a normal mouse, but under the mouse, I think it's quite a scratch, and I think it's the technology that they took before they sent it to their guests, but I'm sure it's not very careful to be scratched, and it's a bit uncomfortable, but it's just missing for five stars."
"Main product, nice, quality, fake brandings, hasn't been released yet."
"I don't care if the mouse's unplugged, but the face underneath the mouse has a lot of scratch, the bottle that's already been used is completely unsatisfactory."
"Rats don't do anything with their hands, they don't make noise and they like to buy two of them."
"However, after five days of use you are not satisfied with the quality of the product, the mouse is not sensitive whether you have changed other batteries for the mouse, click and scan the points incorrectly and or perform the wrong operation."
"I haven't used you yet, but the old one's good.)"
"Buying two birds of the same quality. The new mouse will be slightly more comfortable because of not seeing the noise. Mouse is moving smooth, gentle, long-term clicks can be blinked. Nice mouse design doesn't reach all the comfort you can get, it doesn't understand why the mouse looks a little bit large, it's a little short, maybe the back and the mouse but the mouse is a little bit light, if you hold your finger in front of it."
"Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait"
"Lorcatech M331 itself ok, but the press key is as thin as the nail, which is in the briefcase that's not very careful to turn on the foundation."
"Now, did you just get this package, this rat with the lights on the light down there, the shop? Is this a bad part of it?"
"This mouse is from the silent line so it's very smooth, it's kind of weird compared to the mouse that's going to press the same thing, but the result is the same thing, I order Monday night, Wednesday morning, the original package (with a little stickage), put it in the bubble bag, put it under the top two sponges and put it in the box. The package is good, no filtering, the delivery is fast. the price is cheaper than the store is cheaper."
"I buy a lot of things on tiki, basically a good foundation, a product that's guaranteed to be quality, and one thing that I'm extremely uncomfortable about is that every time I call on CCCCCC, I wait a long time for no one to connect, while I still have to pay for it in the meantime."
"Place the first purchases and payments over Fallopay, so the total goes down 145,000 + high-speed delivery in two hours, so it's only two hours before you get it."
"The mouse is good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's nice, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's a little distance, it's an obstacle."
"It's tough and it's smooth, I've bought five of these for all of us, and I've been using them a few times, but the rubber wraps are soft like the side or the roll will be torn if you let your nails go long."
"I bought a mouse from the end of March, to the beginning of July, which means that, less than four months later, the left mouse didn't eat."
"For five stars, it's always worth it. <i>The whole package doesn't feel torn apart like other friends, the supplier may have changed the procedure.</i>"
"The rat quality is very good, the bright red on the eyes, but speaking to the store about the warranty, it's easy to cut off because it's right on the back of your finger."
"The mouse is quite smooth, does not make noise. Mouse is quite sensitive even to the tabletop; tiki delivery services are fast, less than 2 hours have been received."
"The product is similar to the description, the click is not beeping, the connection is dark, it is smooth, but the mouse scroll is designed to cause pain in your finger when you roll your child (because you have the pointy part around your head)"
Package received.
"I order on Saturdays, I get the package, I don't use it, but I feel it."
"I bought a mouse in the last round, and the mouse clicks were light and quiet, and it didn't make a sound like a normal mouse."
"Thanks to my receipt shop, I've been buying from September 19th, and I've been asking for a receipt, but I haven't seen you send it yet."
"Rats can fit their hands, gentle, nonverbal clicks, and they can adjust their smooth-eyed mouse roll. They can be used on most flat surfaces instead of having mouse underwear like any other mouse. The light is dim but the sensitivity is normal. I've been using them for a few months, and there's no problem. It's very appropriate for those of you who work in a quiet space."
"Rats press small, at night for anyone who wants to use."
"The mouse's strong hand, big butt, gentle mouse clicks, and no sound, the tiger spreads tot. The elephant now passes through."
"The package is fine, the package is clearly packed, blindfolded, the price is reasonable, but the delivery of the box is a bit distorted, but it's acceptable."
"This mouse I've been using for a long time, and my wife saw okay last day, so now I'm buying a new one."
"The package has been returned, was not pleased with the product: %1. Unalted Mouse (the box that was broken may have been used for stamping), has been installed Pin and receiver, has been used. 2. Mouse and box do not match, do not know what the package is.3 Rolls in between are louder and louder than normal mice."
It's off the table.
"It's good, it's tough, it's time to find out."
"I just bought these two mice, a blue one, a red one."
"The sensor, USB attached to the auto-sharp, turn on the mouse switch is automatically connected almost immediately, not waiting. Tiki packaged as carefully as usual, though the shell has a cutting, non-scratch (don't know whether it's due to BH stamp), and the standard delivery is correct. The first feeling is satisfaction, the quality of the quality of the quality still needs to be used for a new breath of time to be defined."
"The mouse fits, the press is very smooth."
"I've been putting the mouse since May 28th, which was a few days ago, and it's not working today, and I hope Tiki solves this quality problem."
"I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry."
"Lightness, No Noise"
"Thank you, Tiki."
Good.
It's a lot lighter than regular rats.
"The mouse designed well, the handle in his hand is still very comfortable. The sensor is smooth. There is no noise click. Only one device is connected through receiver."
It's been almost three months since the purchase.
"I bought this mouse to use at the company because mouse design is pretty good for holding long, but it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay."
"Rats are soft, there's no click sounds when they need to be quiet."
"Logitech M331Helt Plus, but the delivery is Logitech M331 Federal, as an attachment. Generally, OK, but not for wrong delivery reasons for ordering."
"The mouse is sensitive, doesn't listen to click, but it's kind of frustrating because Tiki delivers the product that's already in place."
Pretty cool.
I don't know where the stamps are.
"Tiki delivers the whole package seal, Digiworld's distribution stamp, the mouse that just clicked against the silent quite likes it."
I'm using this second one.
"The new product is 100 percent new and it's extremely fast, and Logotech's mouse is good, and the battery comes with it."
"The mouse is fine, but the serial number, the product code on the mouse/head of different boxes, is not the same set. According to the box shell, the box shell is a 2019 production, but the mouse and the head of the income is 2018."
"Logotech's mouse should be very good quality, battery-mounted, slightly small in size, compared to the person with the size of his hand."
"I'd love to, the first time I'd ever use a mouse with a mouse, and I don't know if I'd like it. A little sad little sile soup is missing. I almost got a satle."
"You're smoother than your old mouse, and your old mouse is M331."
"It's a new black, used by M221; it's time to get M331 more fun, it's beautiful, it's very nice, it's very nice; it's especially true to the name, it's extremely sensitive to sound, it's still hearing tiny clicks; it's much better than others."
"Let's go. Let's go. Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go."
"All right, but you should pick black for dirty exposure."
"Rows, like descriptions, have DigiWorld importers stamps, produced in 2020."
"It's not happy that it's soft, it's not noise, but it's noisy, especially when the wheel is running and it's like there's a lot of hiccups inside, when it's extremely annoying."
"I bought these for you and I used these four types, which are very smooth, but what I just got was a very loud and annoying left mouse click."
"The service is shit. If you can't deliver it by 2 hours, you're gonna have to send an apology."
"I bought this product last July, and now it's April (not a year old) my mouse is showing signs of the left button: ((When I get the package, I don't get the warrants either!"
"Rats are as beautiful as rumours, delivered quickly for three days, black is very nice, but if you don't have a mouse, you'll have a scratch on your lower face."
I was asked if the mouse had been sprained by the mouse's completion or did my mouse fail? The image on TIVI's web does not see this line.
It's only been four months.
"Okay, delivery's fast, new mouse, whole box. Packing's a little bad, but it doesn't matter. But it's still a little small than expected."
"Buying two pieces failed one, returning the warrants for nearly 10 days, tracking the order, waiting to be delivered. Over a week without any information, calling the operator, saying there's no new queues?"
Just 1 year's buy (Jerber 2020). Today 12 December 2021 and the mouse has broken to the left.
"Nice, sensitive, buyable mouse."
"The mouse is fine, but as you can note, the mouse is only connected to the cloud through the income attached to the port web. So let's note that any machine does not have a web port."
"Last time I bought red, this time I bought blue. So far, it's been almost eight months. Rats run smooth, mouse clicks don't listen, no noise."
"Sp held it very firmly, sensuously, smoothly, stablely, so put on more mouse pads."
"I've bought more than a month and I've lost my key, and I'm hoping that tiki will pay me another mouse, thank you."
"Used for a week, the mouse had a seizure display, either when it was lost or when it was delayed."
"Hold on tight, queen, heavy enough. <i>There's no sound.</i> <i>This one's the best wireless mouse.</i> <i>This one's the best.</i> <i>This one.</i> <i>This one's the best.</i> <i>This one's the best.</i> <i>This one.</i> <i>This one's the best.</i>"
"A lot of the complaidians are peeled when they receive it, but I think it's normal, maybe the maker of boxes for stamps, so it doesn't matter."
Everything's fine. I just don't know how long it takes. Let's just vote five.
"This one's already bought two times, a bad key, good quality at the price, and it should be bought by almost two years or so because it's not sensitive."
"It makes a sound but it's very small, but if you're a student at the dorm, you're not going to hear anything."
"The beautiful product, the correct pattern + the color of the delivery faster than expected the use of a few hours of good quality."
"I'm using corny rats with wires before now, and each click is making a sound, and at this point, the mouse can barely hear a sound, and the click is soft and soft."
"Pack it carefully, deliver it fast, get new and good, package it hasn't been torn off, use it for three days and enjoy the feeling of a mouse."
"Tiki delivers quite quickly in the morning, she puts it before the next morning that she gets the goods, which is why she orders in Tiki."
"It's good. Three days of steady production, small compared to my son's hand."
"Mouse outside looks better in the picture, very kate. The press is very smooth, the silent mode doesn't listen to anything, the stress support also doesn't have a light, so it's very pleasant, it's not very bright. Read cmt many of you say no lights."
"Rats are very smooth, almost no noise"
I've bought two mice like this. For myself and one for you. To throw up and throw down is still good. I've got work to do.
I thought from Logitech would be good for officeing.
Yes.
"A good, stable mouse is particularly low on batteries, a rubber weakness that's difficult to clean up when it's used for a long time, and the design isn't very good, but the quality also makes up for some weakness."
That's great.
"The mouse clicks are very smooth, there's almost no noise, even if it takes eight months, the mouse is sensitive. There's a switch to save the battery when it's not used, the battery is quite sustainable, no need to change it."
"Mouse is quite large but appropriate for someone with a big hand, not using the mouse automatically disconnect to make sure that the time of the battery is used, rather intelligently, when it comes to using just the mouse is automatically activated, but you're familiar with the feeling that the mouse click is torn apart and so the feeling of pressing this line is not very good, the advantage of not making noise is not making noise."
"The mouse with the handle on his hand doesn't click, and he hasn't tried it on his lap, so he doesn't know how to roll in the middle, but he's generally pleased."
"Buying this black one on Tiki five months ago, after breaking the left mouse dot key, because there's no more warranty form to buy, but the mouse is not as smooth as the first time, hopefully not as fast as the first one."
"Hand-held, sensitive product."
"tiki delivers on time, clean, beautiful mice, well-used laptops. Mouse, no lights, saves a lot of batteries."
"The delivery mouse opened the box and pasted the other stamps. Old mouse, hk with stamps against fake goods."
"Rats use good, sensitive, beautiful colors, with batteries attached to them."
"We've used the second one. Okay, within range, the civilian mouse kk."
"The quality of the product OKe, packing or shipping is bad."
Great.
"Tot is quite acceptable, and clicks do not want to sound turned out to be by kkk's silent mouse"
"But tiki says there's no stamp on the product, and there's only one letter of digiworld on the outside, and I think there's a stamp on the bottom, and I don't know if it's broken."
"I've always believed in the quality and design of the products that Logotech was working on, and I used Tiki's two-hour delivery service, so the other night I put it in my hand, and the next morning was very, very happy."
"The softest mouse I've ever used, it's easy to handle, it's not too small, it's okay to use MacOS."
"Borrowed, held hands"
Is it true that the dead Tiki luon believed to have the Amazon Chau A?
The first two are more than two years. 2 years is broken. 2 years of life expectancy for prices and experience is fine.
Excellent quality.
"I bought these two sps on tiki. So the first one after two months of failure, and the maintenance request was resuscitated by the same sp off, and then I bought the second product, and then after three months, the rubber mouse roll broke."
"The monologic order of gtk M331 is the first order to use the 2-hour delivery service of tiki. It's extremely pleased with the quality of delivery, because it's very urgent to use mice for meetings."
"It was good, it was smooth, while the whole box was delivered."
"Rats have fallen down a lot of times, but when they pick it up, it's like nothing, it's just because I'm keeping my sleep a little bit."
"The mouse is soft, the mouse doesn't make a sound, the button is very soft, the grip is steady."
"I bought the blue version, the same color as the laptop, so it's kind of cool, I'm telling you, mice are smooth in the evening, I'm not afraid to bother other people, my hands are just the right kind of interested in designing both sides of this product, although it's a bit of a price that's worth paying for, and I don't want to say, I'm also using some of BCtech, which is usually 6-8 months out of a battery, and the producer says I'm waiting to see if that's the case."
"Just open up the box and get us a connection, and it'll fall apart."
"The whole set, her virginity, she almost lost her skin, Digiwold stamp."
"Little mice, good use, quiet..."
Used to be black.
"The product is good, quality, packaged with shocks, core product, 2-hour delivery, friendlyshiper, will continue to support tiki"
"It's very sensitive, it's never been in a fall or a wave, and when you click a mouse, it's exactly the same as the firm's criteria, it's so smooth, you can't hear click, it's so sweet and you like it."
"Tiki delivers fast, rats do well, buy the black one that's not broken but the blue one should buy another one."
"Use it smooth, smooth, slightly larger than you have small hands."
"Good, smooth, precise, 100 times better than a sprain."
"The beautiful model line, which is very sweet, doesn't have an unpleasant click noise, but in order for the mouse to be within a four-meter range of connections to use, there's an occasional loss of connection and a rather uncomfortable shock, so it's better to use a laptop than a desktop machine."
"The warranty went off. It was in July 2019. By August 2020, the mouse had to fail. It bought 350k, it didn't last as long as the Chinese mouse for years."
"It's faster than the schedule for a day, a mouse with a touch and a hand, and it's smooth, and it's the first feeling that it's generally satisfied, and it's the next time it's going to be evaluated."
The product is OK. Click a little bit. Sorry to roll the mouse but it's still small. It's worth it. It's going to take a little bit of a try.
"I get the product that the back has been ripped off, the serial number on the mouse and the shell doesn't match, and I say you have the same situation, but you don't see any response, you should consider it when you buy it."
"It's a pretty big hand, but it's a pretty comfortable hand, and after two weeks it's a really good time, my friends have bought it just like me."
"The mouse handles the dress. - Mouse keys are sensitive, no noise. - sroll is not perfect because it's so smooth it feels like it's not really sensitive. - quick delivery, new goods, carefully packaged."
"The delivery is fast, but the package's a little under-privileged."
"Soft keys, kco. Sound movement. Nothing wrong with that."
"The mouse is smooth, satisfied with the price of the money. However, the mouse does not connect to an ipad without a second (not used for ipad)."
Good.
"The same M331 mouse code as well, but this mouse is silent instead of silent pluss. Mouse has a pre-opened sign at the beginning."
"Anyway, I have a little thought that the mouse series doesn't match the series in the box, and the rest of the product is great."
"So, you know, rats are good, but after a year, the rubber outside of the sprain looks terrible, you have to buy a brand new one, and if you drop it, you could have left or right mouse paralysis."
"The product's okay! The delivery's fast, too."
"Fast delivery, packaged security."
"The mouse is soft and sensitive, and when I use it, I agree with this product, and sincerely thank Tiki for delivering the package a day earlier than she did when she ordered the standard order."
"Hold it steady, drop it fast."
"TikiNW's delivery on time, good package, right now at this price I think it's harder for any mouse to get a piece of this product from Logotech, using Master 2S for desktops, and this one for laptops, big handles, okay."
"The delivery officer was enthusiastic, but the stamps were boring, instead of pasting the flat on the fold, and the result was flying the stamp:"
"Nice mouse. Thank you, shop."
"For about two or three months now, the buffalo battery has turned itself off when it's not used, and the key is soft and quiet just like the ad, and the mouse is so smooth, the mouse is so big, the mouse is so small, but it depends on each person."
I'll be there in a minute. I'll be there in a minute.
"I've been using mice for a year and I've seen that hemorrhoids are still sensitive, soft, battery-saving."
"When I first got the mouse, it seemed like the mouse had been used, I had a new mouse change for two days, but when left mouse click was louder than normal mouse, hajzz. Right mouse was normal."
The good product is perfect. The delivery time is pretty fast. The quality of the product is good.
You guys should buy it?
"The feeling of a good click even though the mouse is smooth and quiet, using many different plane surfaces, not too picky, and the price of the handle is comfortable."
"I've been moving, I've been using a lot of laptops, I've been using this M331 mouse very well, the little mouse is easy to manipulate, it's good for simple jobs like myself."
"Fine mouse, quick handover, but put the addos don't understand why the regular delivery"
Okay.
Use it nice and easy.
"The initial evaluation is beautiful code, soft press, soft hand to relax, quality takes longer use to know"
"I've spent more than two months, and sometimes at night I've been sitting on my ass and not afraid to bother others."
"It's the log company that's trusted, but it still doesn't understand why S/N of rats, receiver and box shells don't match."
"The click is very soft, light, and no audio. The mouse-sharp has a lot to do with the index finger joint."
"Easy, easy, clean, satisfied."
"I love this mouse, because I use it every day, and it's very touchy, and I'm always using this mouse, and I'm always using this mouse, and I'm not so big, and I'm using this mouse, and I'm using this mouse to move."
Tiki asked why the S/N code on the mouse body and the box shell did not match? the mouse click is very smooth
"I got the mouse, the rest of the Seal, the original stables, the heavy mice, the grip of the hand, run good on many kahc1 surfaces."
"I've got a lot of laptops to do, and this is a quality addition to my work."
"I've been in love with this log stick for a long time and I've been using this logtech silent, so I've got good quality, so I've bought another one on how to use it and I'm not disappointed."
"A nice mouse, a dress, and a hug, a button that is so sensitive and quiet that no noise is made; an office, which is so good to use, should be found and used at home."
"I just bought it, but I saw light under and above the light?"
"I also saw that the code on the mouse with the box wasn't the same, and the box wasn't exactly the same, but I thought it was possible to paste the seal, and the mattress under the mouse was a little scratchy, and the mouse was new, and the mouse wasn't scratching, and the mouse was good, and the mouse was soft, and it wasn't listening, and the ear was very small."
"A lot of you have feedback, which is that it makes you wonder at the bottom of the mouse, but when you take things and use them, you feel that you don't have anything to do with the quality, you hit them very smooth, you know, compared to your old mouse, it's like heaven."
"Reading review scared me, too, but after I got it, I fell in love with her."
"It's exactly M331, quiet, sensitive."
"I bought it on tiki checking, so I'm not worried about the quality of the product. I've been using sp for almost four months, fast, battery-saving."
The delivery is three days later than the plan.
"Buying this product from September 2017 but until now has been a time for review. This product has become an integral part of its job. The USB 3.0 connection device is extremely sensitive. I use mice for Macbook Air machines after which it is extremely easy to move to other machines. Mouse moves smoothly, and especially prefers not to produce loud audio when you click it. The accompanying battery has been used more than 6 months and is not finished."
"It's very final, very little noise, very expensive."
"Buying one day, the next day the battery ran out (not seeing the same note in the page of the product). When you call it a new item, you say it's a scratch under the bottom of the mouse, you have two new and old warehouses.) So if you don't see the same amount of money, you can get the same product with different quality."
"Fast delivery, mouse clicks smooth, but it's a little small-handed."
"The quick delivery, the red mouse is pretty nice, the really smooth, and it's soft and it doesn't make any noise, and the red looks really good, so it's better than a 150K wireless mouse."
"You know, if you like ""Go up and use it,"" like you use a Rolex, you should buy it."
"It's smooth, it's very sensitive, it's not clicky, Tiki delivers super fast."
Six months of good quality and quality.
It's worth a lot of money.
"Although I'm a girl, my hand's a little big, so this mouse is about 10 inches long, and I can barely hold it, and I can't feel my fingers."
"I just picked her up this morning, and there's no sign of warranty, and I don't know what happens if there's a problem with the warranty?"
"Rats use sensibility, quiet, quiet space to hear clicks, needs to be used for office offices, so this one's too much."
It's easy to use.
"A soft mouse with no noise, no beauty."
"It's cheap, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good."
"The click is very smooth and rollin' very smooth, and it's better to keep your face dirty on the side of the mouse!"
"We've been using one of these red ones for three years, buying more blues in case we go to work and forget about the mouse at home."
"Ok, the mouse is smooth with the hand, no noise, long-term blue rat gets dirty without knowing what to do with the solution..."
"Light mouse, nice color, low battery cost."
Fine mouse
"The image described the PIN 24 hours. The content is too poor. Sets daily 27 dates on 29 which by now is 21h45p doesn't see the delivery move? the customer's responsibility is too bad. don't know what the quality product is yet, but the attitude with the customer's application is unacceptable."
"It's quiet, it's a long time battery."
"The box's a little rough, but there's no picture of the mouse. Nice mouse, because it's silent, so it doesn't sound familiar?"
"Package received, sp packaged thoroughly, whole box stamp, medium-hand, soft-smoothed mouse"
"Mouse was good, smooth... bought from Tiki three years ago, lost the other day, now bought another one."
Main quality mouse. Hold the dress. Click the mouse button to hear. Be comfortable when you're working constantly or playing games.
"A nice, soft mouse press doesn't hear the sound, the package is packed carefully, the box is empty."
Dive smooth mouse. Click quiet. Move quickly. Click quiet.
"I bought a third one, bought it for your parents, and I bought it for you, and I bought it for your parents, and I bought it for you, and I bought it for me, and I bought it for you, and I bought it for you, and I got it for you, and I got it for you."
"Nice style, smooth operation, sensitivity."
"Yeah, I'll buy it back."
"It's quite satisfying, the mouse is smooth, the package is opened to paste but it's very boring to be sprained and it's loose! I don't know if it's still being preserved."
"Fine, smooth, no voice"
"After setting for more than 2:30, the mouse was received. It was good for Macbooks and also for WlSIGS, which moved the mouse very smoothly, and clicked lightly but shallowly, so it was easy to hit the wrong one."
"The mouse is comfortable, sensitive, and for a few months it feels good to use it."
"Right product, quality, smooth, package and quick delivery."
"It's good to use it, it's very quiet and it's very quiet."
The delivery is coming as fast as the New Year's.
Serial Number in the box doesn't match Seral Number on the product.
"I used to use a lot of different types of mouse for Macbook computers, but after using this kind of mouse, I felt very pleased. The features on the mouse are as perfectly and as comfortable as when using Magic Mouse or Touchpad."
Nice mouse with Digiworld's main distribution stamp.
"I've been buying for less than three months, and it's actually been broken for about a month after I've bought it, but it's so busy and I don't know where it is that I'd like to ask if I could send this mouse through some kind of utility protocol like Grab or fast delivery?"
"How can I buy a time when I have a problem not receiving mice? <i>I wonder if it's a product error or a misuse!</i> <i>From the time I bought it, I've had six months to preserve it twice.</i>"
"Soft Mouse, smooth press"
The delivery didn't go in until 10 p.m. The delivery wasn't delivered until 10 p.m. came home and found it at home.
"You put in a two-hour order, at 13 o'clock, you check the delivery system, you get shiper to sign."
"Newly used, quite smooth, the whole belt has dropped, still good, clear."
"Nice, smooth, expensive mouse."
"I bought it here for the third time, and I used it every time."
"So far, I've been using mice for over four months and I'm completely satisfied with the product, and what's really exciting about it is that clicks don't make the sounds like many of the other mice I used before, and in my use, I've dropped mice four or four times, but I'm okay, and I'm really happy that I bought this product."
"In approximately 288K, you can't find this one:"
"The product's exactly the way it's described. I'm not sure if it's worth it, but I don't know if it's going to last."
Satisfy about the product.
Buying rats from 7/9 for more than a week doesn't make any sense.
"The box is worn out like an old thing, tiki explain it to me."
"Takes some time to bring out the review. Soft mouse, mouse clicks don't sound too loud."
Good stuff. I've been using it for almost three years.
"The product that was advertised as silent activity, while left mouse mice were silent but the mouse roll sounded quite uncomfortable, it felt as if it were a pain, it affected the experience of working and surfing the web."
The new product is set with Digiworld's official stamp.
"The good product, the package, the appropriate delivery staff, the good stuff has been going on for almost half a year now."
"The mouse is much smoother than normal. The connection is fast, stable, and can wake up the machine from sleep mode."
"I buy black mice and I get the right black product, but I check the mouse can and it's red. The mouse is actually quite smooth, but the pressure is reduced to normal mouse, not deep."
"Standard order, light clicks, exactly as advertised..."
"I've been using more than a week, the first feeling is I've got a very good hand, good material, a very sensitive click, a much more effective job support."
Okie
Good. Good. Good.
"This unwired mouselined mouseline is quite suitable for himself, and it clicks smooth mouse and small noise, and the mouse is comfortable and small, which comes with the laptop because he regularly has to move."
It's okay. It'll take a long time to find out how long it lasts.
"A soft mouse doesn't make a sound, it's worth it, it's a pleasure, but I hope it lasts a month to buy a new line."
"The package is carefully packed, and the average mouse quality for letting our head receiver a little bit further away is that the mouse twitches a little bit uncomfortable and the distance is about 40 centimeters away."
"Mouse has a design for right-handed people, very hand-to-hand people. The rubber around the mouse body is good for controlling and lifting mice."
How did you get two months without a battery when you introduced yourself to 24 months ago?
"This is an old mouse photo that bought and used six months ago, and now buys another one for another."

"It's okay to use silence, but it doesn't feel good to press it because of the silent mouse."
"Rats don't make noise when you click, hold hands, tiki delivers on schedule, and the product remains intact."
Okay.
"Main mouse, carefully packed, delivered quickly"
"It's been three months now, the battery's not gone yet, but the rough side it's too easy to hold on to, the longer it's used, the easier it is to get dirty."
"It's fine. You can't touch it, you can't. You'll bet again."
"Quality is good, durability is a long way to know."
"Can we just open the box, the product that looks like it's been used?"
"The mouse received after three days of the delivery of Tiki's order. The package is exactly as recommended. The package is now in good use, and should be bought. The seal here is equal to the other party and is delivered free, unlike the one that time the transportation fee is too high that it should be ignored."
The product's OK.
"This rat is using very well, it could be said that the techs should buy this mouse, they can't hear, they can't even hear it, and especially save the battery."
"I bought 58590 hours to this 311, and the two of them clicked on it."
It's been almost a month. It's been a pleasure. It's been almost a month.
"By and large, we've used a lot of the Voltechian mouselines, and the old silent mouse is broken, so we need to buy something new, and we've got a much better sense of holding hands, a reasonable sensitivity to office tasks."
The crazy dads value people 3*4.
"I ordered it yesterday at noon, Tiki delivered it during the afternoon."
"I've been using Logotech's stuff for years, and I have to admit that its persistent buffalo is rarely equal to any brand, and hopefully it's broken to change it, but it's not the rats whose wireless keyboards are super strong, it's palming, remember the price of buying a keyboard is 375,000, and this M331 is the lowest."
"Good delivery, quick delivery, carefully packed, full-size team marks. Rats press the dress, almost no audio on the press, generally too ok at the price of the price."
"It's a nice, quiet mouse, but it's not an attack, so let's buy it."
"The newly bought mouse is OK, the battery has been following the mouse for about two or three weeks, and then it's been about two months, and there's been a shock, even though it's just starting to run out of batteries, but after the battery change, it's still jerking off."
"Fast delivery, ordered by the next morning, delivered quickly by the right product code, lucky not to have failed the package code as the previous reviewer."
"It's been a while, but it's a pleasure to deliver because it's the right color and the quality is too good:"
"Rats are sensitive, they're smooth, they're smooth, they're OK, they're exactly the same."
It's cheap and it's good.

"I can't see you till Monday, cancel, let's go out and buy it quickly."
"I don't know if it's as long as M185, it's new that I haven't tried it yet. It's so smooth at first."
"The delivery is extremely fast, the mouse is smooth, the company, the box is not cut, the box is packed with a big box, but no more shockproof insertion."
"When I use it, my fat cat won't find it."
"Real rats, let's eat! OK! OK! OK!"
"The code has two more ulcers, which is really nice. It's amazing how cool the sun is holding the baby. It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter."
"The whole set, the mouse click is very smooth and the knuckles. Let's take some more time."
"Got the mouse in 2 hours of delivery, got the new black one, got the new one, got the battery ready, and the important thing was that the clicks were very smooth, and the fingers were great."
"The product is solid, smooth, little noise."
It's very quick and it's nice and it's nice and it's nice and it's good and it's good and it's good and it's good and it's good and it's good and it's good and it's good and it's good and it's good.
"The new product is OK, the mouse is smooth, it takes a long time to get sustainable, the difference is that Tiki's long-term delivery, the delivery is two times late, and it's almost half a month before I get it, and I hope Tiki improves the problem."
"Let's just say it's too percolate, ordered at 1:07 PM 19/05, then 9:52 am 20/5 got the package."
"It's a perfect fit, it's a soft plastic body, so it's a sad scratch. It's fun."
"Rats are smooth, they're nice, they're good, they're good, they're good to go, they're good to go, they're good to go, they're good to go, they're good to go, they're good to go, they're good to go, they're good to go, they're good to go."

"Good products, firms, soft, soft, sensitive clicks"
"Super quick delivery, smooth mouse"

I just added one for my colleague using Macbook. It's a compliment for a steady connection.
"The product is properly described, using smooth hands."
"Last September we bought a black one, so now the left mouse is broken."
"The flowers on both sides of the mouse’s body were dirty and very hygienic, which was also broken after a period of use."
"There's a lot of easy, light, soft things in a wireless mouse."
"The real rat, digiworld for a year."
"This product has a good complete quality, hardly hearing clicks when you type a keyboard, because the mouse has no strings, so when you use it a little bit later when you click on the button but the level that you get for using office needs doesn't allow you to have a high-speed mouse. If you want to use it for the need to play the game, it's going to be better for games than this mouse. Thank you so much for bringing yourself such a perfectly good-quality mouse, it's going to buy so much higher quality."
The goods in Tiki trackling that haven't done anything yet have been scratched on the bottom of the mouse.
"The button is not as loud as it's called, but it's also why the push is not as good as the click type. It's appropriate for working at night. Good design, holding hands, receiver gets well."
"Tiki delivers fast, package carefully, product in shape, especially without noise, press very gently"
"Rats have been enjoying it, no noise, for three years, still okay."
"Use it well. Be gentle, don't play sound."
That's awesome!
"It's been eight hours in a row since the delivery of both the work and the game, the smooth and sensitive mouse, which is what it's supposed to be."
The product on tiki is pleased with the next five stars that continue to support the shop
"The company's main product, the price is cheaper than any other place, and if you don't mind sending BH, then buying on the tmdt floor is a good option."
Soft click mouse
"The company's main goods, good use, no noise, fast delivery (1.5h). SP's whole boxes, not yet available to paste the issue, so we don't know what the maintenance policy is like."
Nice style.
Good quality product.
I got a lot better blue in the picture.
"It's only been a week, so I don't know if there's any on the other side. There's no problem with the mouse right now, no problem with the delivery sooner than a row."
"Tiki delivers fast, packaged carefully, fixed design, and Logitech brands have ensured the quality of the product."
"- The hand-held mouse likes very much, for the person with the little hand - clicks very smooth, doesn't make sound - the sensitivity"
"Tiki delivers fast, packs carefully, when there is a battery available in the M331 M331 mouse mouse mouse, which is beautifully designed, he's black, he's got his hands in his hand, he's holding it gently, he's not making any noise, he's making a quick connection, he's doing well at the price, he's going to need time to test it."
"Now, do you want a warrant, or do you want a warrant?"
"Rats go by precisely, they don't have to be slow when they go like any other mouse, they're perfect to draw the details, they use four or five before they find you."
"The gumlents are as quiet as grain, using the office as well."
"The first time I wrote review for tiki, because I was so interested in this buy, the mouse was so good, it didn't sound good when the mouse was flashing."
"Good, long-term."
"The rat's super smooth, and just like his name is, gud gud, but the drop box somewhere has to be."
"Rats are sensitive and use very much. Click to hear the real noise, and work will not affect others, but it's important to use endurance."
The warranty hasn't been back on 21 days.
"I bought it once in a second time, new one, non-scrambled backside, intact seal, the delivery was on time."
"Fast delivery time, product exactly as described, high quality."
"It's good, it's good, it's good, it's light."
"The delivery is much sooner than expected to satisfy me; the quality of the mouse is also very pleasant, smooth, and very smooth."
"Suppressing, holding, and holding, 1,000 DPI resolution, shouldn't be very sensitive:) Best activity with mousepad."
"It's smooth, it's swampy, it's good. It's good."
"With good use, there's no mistakes, but if you spend a short amount of time, you'll get dirty-looking rubber pads."
"I used to think that B175 had to buy this one, and in the end it's under 300k mouse using MacBook Pro that's more likely to be run over the point where I wanted to have a little bit of fun in exchange for the style, the color, the right button, and the non-smoking mouse button."
"Although the mouse is in a new state, the box is opened first"
I'm buying a blue girl. Good stuff.
It's beautiful. It's very stable.
Rats use oke for the price of money.
"You're so cute, you're so cute, you're so cute, but for people like you, they're a little big."
"The product is exactly the same as the description. It's still intact. Next time, it'll back up."
It's good. It's good. It's good. It's good.
"The package is solid; it likes Tiki's canning; the mouse moves really smooth, because it's Kreat, so clicks don't make a sound."
"The product is exactly the same as the sample, good use, light, and this mouse-line is going to be a smooth touch without making any noise."
Cool.
"Good sp, use very fancy, buy from tiki trick so secure quality????"
The plastic pad on the back of the mouse has been scratched a lot.
"Snail, steady, worth buying."

Okay.
"I just bought it back, and I found this earpiece so ridiculously designed, instead of putting it directly into my ear, like this earpiece on the sound that goes directly into my ear, and it's going to be a little bit of a pain in your ears, you should think about it before you buy it, and I'm kind of disappointed."
"The volume is too soundy for this low price. The volume is not too low for details. The biggest subtraction is the amount of microphones, the recording sounds very shy and much noise, and the sound of the other person's microphones is so much that they don't listen at all... it's generally appropriate to listen to each other rather than to have a meeting."
"- Beauty, right. - Good sound. - Not the sound button on the earpiece. - I use it when I ride my bike, so it's low noise, it's still known for sound, but for use in the house, it's relatively okay."
"Nice headset, quick delivery, but I'm trying to get into my laptop or my phone, and I can't hear you."
"The hearing is fine, the first time you've got a small side error, plus a faint sound, shop+ tiki's giving you support in two days, the next time you get an ear is not wrong, the next time you hear it sounds pretty good, it sounds good, it's worth the money, for four stars, because you've checked your ear before you deliver it."
"Sound sounds good, for a price like that. Okay, I'll support you if there's a need for the next purchase."
"I've just bought a day, I've broken it, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry."
"It's small, it's neat, it's easy for boxes and it doesn't hurt to lie down, it's kind of bassy, it's pretty beat, it's good for music."
"The product is relatively good compared to the amount it's spent, Tiki delivers it quickly, packs it carefully."
"It's okay, with the destruction of his earset -- it's going to fall to the ground, and so this ear is going to live for six and a half months, and the other side is going to sound good."
"It's a good package, it's a nice model, it's not very nice to listen to music, it's all your money, it's good to play games or talk."
"Sound sounds good, earpieces small, fast transport, price good."
"Early delivery, the product's pretty good, but the volume is not the same, but compared to the price, it's okay."
"Sound OK, wear a earache, try the smallest one and still hurts, I don't know if I'm going to have to wear the wrong one."
"It sounds good, it's good, it's bad noise, but it's been a bit of a pain in the ear, it's a shock from the closed ear."
"Quick dirty because white, sound is fine within a year, if you use preservatives that can be used for two years, when you buy it, because cheap is the main thing."
"The sound is good. It's good. It's good. It's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good. It's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good."
"It's well packed, it's steady, it's good for the price."
"I can hear you, but you can't hold on for three months, you can only hear one side."
I don't know why I'm using a laptop that sounds like I'm making some sort of automatic adjustments.
"Okay, let's go. Let's go. Let's go, let's go, let's go."
We haven't used it in two days. We're down on one side.
It's not what you think it is. It's not what you think it is.
The new earpiece is as dirty as it used to be.
"I'm bored, I hear one on the other, I hear the other on both sides, but it's the other on the second day."
"The sound is so heavy, it's kind of... it's kind of... it's kind of... it's just... it's kind of... it's just... it's just... it's just... it's kind of... it's just... it's... it's... it's just... it's... it's... it's... it's just... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's just... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's..."
"The short-use hearing is low, quick, I've been using less than two months. I've lost my voice in my ear."
"Very good, sir. Thank you."
"There was an error in jumping a song when you stuck it in your phone and put it in your pocket, trying some other headsets, and it didn't matter."
It's okay.
I've been hearing it for about six months and my ear is broken.
"The product buys it once, use it savagely, buys it twice, uses it badly."
The quality is unappreciated.
"Okay, well, it sounds good, but when you put it on, it always falls off, so it's not very comfortable, but the quality's okay."
"Okay, well, it's within range."
"Sound good, price appropriate, package carefully"
OK.
"It's easy to use, but it's good for the price range."
"135K doesn't require more than an A. So put more money on sp than a very small, weak string, ae consider"
The material isn't very sustainable.
"Relative sounds, soft little wires... fine."
I bought him English so he'd meet his needs.
Good for the price.
It doesn't sound as good as earpieces of the same segment.
I ordered two of them to deliver one.
The price is fine.
"One hand is clear, one arm is too timid to hear!"
"The hearing ear is forbidden. One side can hear, and the other one can hear it."
"Good, small, cheap, good."
"The tip of the error wire, plugs into the computer at no time. The color is much lighter in the image."
It's a good ear. It doesn't have a bad ear. It's very smooth.
It's fine. It's fine.
"Quick delivery, short delivery box, backup earplugs."
I just bought one in my ear for a few days and I can't hear a thing.
"Use unknowns, say others can't hear hichic"
The product quality's fine at the price price.
"Tiki delivers the good stuff, I call it black, but it's white."
That's too bad. We could use it for a couple of days.
It's not even been a week since the earpieces were so annoying.
"The receiver's ear's been timid about losing his right ear, which is very annoying."
"The fragile design, using it less than a month, broke off on one side."
"Use it well, it sounds like it's going to fit the price range."
It's okay.
Or a hearing error.
"All right. All right, all right."
"Headsets don't match IP, plug them in very shy."
Good.
Sounds good.
Or a mic failure.
"Sometimes on the big side, there's an opening in the left ear or something."
"It's steady, it's good. It's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good."
"The product's fine, the quality's gonna take some time to figure it out."
It's a little awkward. I'll take it at the price.
"Wearing earaches, it's easy to drop out."
We haven't heard in a month. We've lost a T.T. earpiece.
That's great. That's just great. That's all I'm saying.
"It sounds good, but it hurts a little."
"I'm fine, but I'm feeling pretty bass, but the microphone's a little low."
Quick and clear delivery!
sustainable
Good stuff.
Normal Sound Quality
"Sound good, rope's a little short."
We're good. We're good. We're good.
It's okay. It's a little small.
Or get caught in the ear. Okay.
"All right, the cable's a little short, but we don't know yet."
"It's a little annoying, but it's good within the price range."
One side listens to each other loud and small.
"The headset's fine, but the mic's got a problem."
"Use it fine, it tickles my ears"
Ggg
It's okay.
It sounds big on the small side. Sometimes you can't hear it.
"Fast delivery, temporary quality versus price."
Okay.
It's okay.
"It sounds good. It's good. It's good, it's good, it's good."

The left ear doesn't sound as clear as the right ear.
It's not good.
"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
"It sounds good, but it's broken."
One day's use is broken.
Quality ok
"The wire's broken, so don't buy it."
"Rows like pictures, long-term transactions."
It's the same as the envelope.
The product's okay.
It's not good. I don't know.
"Listen to me, it's not okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay."
Fine!
"Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine."
Shy at the mic?
They're not exactly advertising.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Quick delivery.
"After five years of depleting the left ear of ap2 with just a left earpiece, there's also a question between ap3 and pro2 that I've decided to go pro2 in-ear to develop the power of both equal ears, and there's a lot more choice but to buy airpods just to fit into the epidemitic ecosystem!"
"I buy 15 iophone here, they buy more airpods."

The good sale price hunt tiki is playing self-destructing singles
"The first impression to receive from Tiki is that everything is very well packed! For this 64Gb memory card, after two weeks of use, it feels good to be satisfied: its capacity, its speed, its origin, its official product production (IpJet). For Tiki Trading, I feel secure about the quality of the product that we buy and the value of the product is very valuable if people are constantly watching on Tiki app!"
"The price's good, the use's good, there's no problem until now."
"The package is packed as carefully as possible. The warranty is clear. The visual product is new. The two weeks it feels good to use it most if the card later fails to reevaluate whether or not the 59/64GB memory is normal or not, I don't know."
"I got it from the shop, I didn't run it, I just got it back, I felt it right, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it."

"Tiki works as well as he always does, fast delivery and quality goods, memory tags can be used, thank you Tiki and shipper."
"One thing I'm buying is 12/6/2021, where the warranty stamp of April 2021 doesn't know whether the warranty timer sp is counting by tiki's bill or the stamp on the memory card?"
Fast delivery is only two days before you get it.
"I just got the goods, so I haven't used much, but it's brand new, too, I hope."
"Speed, camomi, and ezviz, before buying cheap cards, were saved at a time when errors occurred."

"The product that comes out after a week of trial feels good, and it's a little bit surprised that the envelope has been torn open, but remember that Tiki Trading sold it, so it's reassuring to tear it out for the maintenance stamp."
I don't think it's a good idea to use mere villi.
The product is exactly what the salesman described it to be.
It's a lot cheaper than fucking!

Very good.
Okay.
The product's been buying for over a week.
I'm good at it. I'm fast and I'm not bad at it.
There's no mistake making new delivery.
"The delivery is exactly the same as the client's choice, the warm, friendly worker, the specs are almost exactly the same as the ad, the quality of feedback after a time of use."
"Just got the product too disappointed, and the paper box was opened in shape, and the test-put on the car said the memory card failed, and please convert the product to make sure the customer's raw quality is restored."
"Tiki delivers between noon at 12:30 p.m. at bedtime. Unsatisfying about this delivery time. Be careful of the package with no receipts, only electronic bills. The product has been cut open for print stamps. Checks the speed of reading quite slowly not as expected. but is generally OK with this amount of money, no more demanding. The rate is between 4-6M/s. The previous tags are less likely to buy about 9 m/s with the same file. Can see the speed to see the speed of the image."
"I set the delivery for 2 hours so fast I can't use the IP camera (I.P.) on the phone, OK, the flow is too big when I attach it to the memory card tray on the phone, I don't know if there's a warranty). There's only two problems left, and that's OK."
"This order was bought at the same time, but until now unconfirmed, while the orders above have been received, Tiki used to be fast, but now it's too slow."
"Packed well, delivered on time, quality product, price appropriate, consistent with the need to use"
It's urgent to buy aship for 2 hours. I don't know if anyone's gonna get a card.
"Quick delivery, right type, good use."
It's not good but let's try it.
"The actual capacity of the card is more than 50,49 GB."
"It looks multi-opened, you know if there's a deadline for warranty or old goods."
"I bought it for a little bit more than a week, but when I moved the file from memory memory through the memory card, most of the files that came through the memory stick, and I couldn't get theformat card."
"Good cards, company stuff, very reassuring purchases."
"Fast delivery. It's easy to understand that pulley seal is supposed to post the market's warranty stamp, but the speed of Read/Write isn't right for advertising."
"M asked you about the technical request so that you could copy the apps from the machine to the memory card, and you said that Android 6.0 or so up is okay."
"I used a card for nokia 7.2 - androi 10, after backuping the video on your photo via the card, the phone can't read the pictures and videos on the card, please guide or only this card is like this, please preserve"
"The real product, the whole box, the stamp, the quality must be used to evaluate it."
Ok.......
"It's a big, bad sticker, plus having to put it in the machine, so it's a little tight in the inside, and it takes almost a week to deliver it, like when you order it, Tiki's only going to tell the factory how long it's going to take, and it's going to take a lot of Tiki's over time, and it's going to be much better than she's going to spend on her delivery than she is. It's just smoking, so it's good to make her customers happy."

"2022 packages received without memory cards, lost money, lost trust in Tiki, Tiki Trading, and I'll never buy Tiki again."
Buying a camera without knowing how to contact a salesman.
"The product isn't exactly the reality of advertising 64GB, but it's only 59,45GB disappointed."
"Put the three on the security camera, after nearly two months of broken memory cards, keep canceling the error, and ask for reformation, and what's that?"
"I'll buy a Tiki order. Now, can you make an appointment tomorrow morning, I agree, but let's be clear before 10:30 a.m. the next morning, because we're on the move."
"Okay, download the quick-phone clip, watch it directly."
"It was the right company card, but it was observed that some of the cardmates had cut off a line in the envelope (likely taking out the store’s seal) cards that were fine, read fast, copied quickly."
I'll check the memory cards. It's 59GB.
"It's 64 gb, and it's only 6 g."
It's only 59.9 hours.
"It's supposed to be delivered on time, but why the card remembers 64GB but puts it on camera to get 59,5GB."
Bags. OK. Quality's for evaluation.
"I've just bought this one, and the speed of recording is 17M/s the empty memory is 119GB, but it's safe to buy it on Tiki anyway."
It's okay. It's gonna take more time to evaluate the durability.
Good.
"I mean, I'm not really interested in that, but it's very rare to buy it because it's time-deprived and it's urgent."
"Camera cards, I don't know how to judge them."
"I don't think 64G's ever seen any errors. It's more likely to be 59G. It's full of stamps, but it's a little off-the-book that makes it a little bit harder to put in the machine."
Circumcision — Before Use
"The product I bought failed, and the computer can't read it in this card and constantly report an error. Please contact Tiki and contact me if I can change this card."
It takes 20 percent of the preservative time.
"It's a pretty nice package, but the package is cut as good as the good stuff and then re-plug it. Never even tried its product efficiency."

I'm just using it. OK. Food supply is 59.5GB.
The card won't work for a month.
"The delivery was too slow, and the camera was three days slower, and the quality was unknown."
Automatic satisfaction of taking the product apart
The delivery is later than expected.
Row OK
The original package has been torn off (likely for sealing); the quality is unknown because it has not yet been used.
"It's a camera tag that's OK, but when you take it, it's already cut, it's a little disappointed about how it's done, so it's better to change."
Hang out. Okay.

"I got a memory card today, and I put it in a machine that didn't eat memory cards, wanted backup."
"The wrong product, not the same shape."
"Quick delivery, enthusiastic staff."
One doesn't take the device.
"The pickets have been peeled off Seal's shell, there's a incision in the box shell and trays of memory cards in the box."
It's a little expensive. I've been trying to figure out the quality for a while.
"I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry."
Used for bad camera use just read/write at the same time so Lag
"What's the big deal? What's the big deal? What's going to stick on the memory card, like, two stamps."
Don't you know yet?
Why do you put your memory stick on your travel camree and the camera doesn't get the card?
The product is exactly like advertising.
"There's 60 Gs, okay."
"Stick to the phone that works fine, wait for time to respond to the durability."
The delivery is sooner than expected.

"Good, good, good, good."
"It's good to buy it, but it's not going to work. It's not going to work. It's got a stamp on it."

"The mouse is smooth, the mouse is given a very smooth mouse table, and the mouse is charged with a battery, the micro-usb charge -- the price of the web-c port is out of the question."
I hope it lasts.
"Rats are good for money. >> Noise clicks are very impressive. >> Except: - Consesses sometimes get jerked, slow; must be due to loss? <i>The person who needs to roll a lot will be a little bit uncomfortable. <i>I don't like it when you use them.</i> <i>The mouse turns pink.</i> <i>The design is not good, and the quality is bad for knowing the cheap stuff right away.</i> <i>It's still five stars.</i> <i>That's why this is so good.</i> <i>"

"The mouse's fine, it's not loud, it's sometimes like the real mouse, it's blue, it's not like it's red."
It's been a couple of days. I've been looking forward to it.
"Well, it's okay to use it as an office, it's okay to play games, it's not the best perfection, but at this price, it's good, five stars."
"Soft, beautiful, smooth mouse"
The rat buys it very well.
Softly used goods
I can't believe it's a good idea to get such a good mouse at a low price.
"Good, nice, comfortable use."
"The Mk is experiencing the product, and it's good, and for as long as it takes you, you don't know."
The average pattern should be very cheap.

"Shipper, who delivers the goods so irresponsiblely, throws them in a non-visible platform, asks why Shipper dumps the goods there, who doesn’t expect to deliver them directly, and shipper says, “You go 20 miles [20 km] to deliver them, and for the first time you meet shipper, you have a disrespectful attitude toward this kind of delivery."
"You just got the charge, you got the charge, you got the charge, you got the charge out, the mouse on the right is paralyzed, you know what it's worth, but you have to at least give people a month to spend, and they don't have half an hour to talk."
"Advantage: cheap prices can help with urinary batteries, which are anti-symbolic."
"No longer used for long periods of time, but generally the price is okay. If the mouse is not on smooth surface, it's hard to move the mouse:""it's also good to give a mouse pad when the mouse itself is moving hard on the mouse pad."
"The first time you're on it is fine. <i>Slow click, buffalo battery, short charge.</i> <i>But for a few months it's starting to give you a nice, long shot.</i> <i>The charge will break.</i> <i>The cost is fine.</i> <i>It'll be fine.</i> <i>It'll be fine.</i> <i>It'll be fine.</i> <i>It'll be fine.</i> <i>It'll be fine.</i>It'll be fine.</i> <i>It'll be fine.</i> <i>We'll be fine.</i> <i>It'll be fine.</i>It'll be fine.</i>It'll be fine.</i> <i>It'll be fine.</i> <i> <i> <i>I'll be fine.</i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i>"
"Moves the mouse smooth, the press is gentle. Style OK. Package well, deliver carefully."
"Buying it for two months is suddenly the right mouse button is paralyzed, it's not getting a signal."
"The soft press, moving the mouse on the table, is sometimes a bit rusty. The color is elegant. Automated mode saves the battery quite well."
"One month's use, no use, no buy."
The right mouse button may not be so smooth as it is right
"It's too bad, mouse."
"Light mouse, nice color, quiet noise, smooth click."
"Rats have been channeled, they're beautiful, but they've got to give one star."
"If it's wrong, the dill has lag. If you use a few minutes, you're going to have to reconnect the mouse."

It's nice to deliver fast
You can't move rats without 10 days' worth of money.

"Sell the stuff, the stuff doesn't get paid, when the shop's made a mistake."
It's broken after two weeks of product use.
Don't use non-use mice.
The last two days are bad.
"Batteries are too low, we've got three or four days to charge."
"The mouse is stable, and sometimes the mouse has to be unsympathetic."
"It's all right, it's all right, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good."

Use it quickly. It's bad.

"I've been thinking about it before, but it's pretty much OK, and it's better than buying tgd or cellphones."
"There's a German import stamp that's okay. Don't need any code. Guys, read some review 1-2 that's funny. Now this is my most detailed charge on Tiki floor: charge Apple on the edge of the very sharp border, tap the same as the iPhone's attached cable, clear print, equally sharp, Made in China, the speed of charging like Apple's ad ad, remember to speed up to 80 percent will be slow and cool as if it isn't for some reason you're still adding, that's the correct thing to understand."
"With FPT stamps on it, you should rest assured that compared with some of the previous users with the item in the box, which is not exactly the case."
"I don't know what it's like to go to the store, but tiki shits don't know about it, I hope they don't."
"The Shop is 100 percent accurate, and I suspected before I bought it, but when I got the checkouts, from the inside out, the old serials and boxes, the electric plugs were all so good, so standard."
"The package sure, fast delivery, by choice of tikinow, is a bit high, but there's a constant code that should be accepted, set for 4:30 p.m., 7:30 p.m., got a lot of satisfaction."
"It feels pretty good to know if it's going to be an error, but please let me ask, is it 12promax?"
"It's genuine, it's charged OK, it's five stars"
"The battery goes up quickly, but it's not good for the battery, it's not good for the battery, I charge 12 prox."
"It's auth's raw product distribution by FPT, which is yesterday's quick delivery, which is cheaper in mobile, electric supermarkets."
It's VN new company.
"The code scan didn't come out but check serical and the charge match, check out the box and in - this note is oklakak yYYY"
"I don't know if it's the real product. No, you said there was a fpt stamp. Why didn't you see it?"
"The delivery was too fast, but I bought it without noticing that gate C should have to buy more wire, a little bit expensive, but quite pleased with the product."
"The main charge is not a table, so use the company's own charge, if there's anything against Apple."
"Delivering him because of tiki now, buying electronic products on tiki, reassuring about the source, all the electronics, the ice, the electricity, the electricity, all the intelligence of tiki."
"The main product, the whole set, the delivery to the hands in good condition, no roughness, no tearing."

"Buying with iPhone 11, that's a great experience!"
"- One day's quick delivery, I love tiki in the package and the delivery."
"The battery charge is fast, the delivery service has been very good since it's been bought, I don't know how it's been since it's been bought, it's good and cheap, you should buy it."
The main product OK should buy this product
"The whole set, very good, very fast delivery, puts it up by noon at the beginning of the afternoon."
"It's 12 promaxs. 30 minutes up about 50 percent. From 85 percent up, it's a slower charge. The machine and the warm charge are hot."
Is it true that everyone bought a Zoho/a machine and went to the same house?
"The company's main, hunting 11-11 for 370K is so good!"
"The product's the right way, the whole set, the package is in short supply, the quick delivery, and hopefully the use will be fine."
"The product's fast, it'll probably take a long time to evaluate it."
"Very fast delivery, quality product, hand-held grips, just missing one that doesn't have Fpt stamps."
I don't have much use yet. I really don't feel good about shipper. I really don't feel bad for shipper.
"Yeah, well, let's make sure we don't just charge, let's make sure everyone in the mk has to buy more than five o'phones here, so let's just buy it from here, let's buy it from here, let's say it's cheap, it's worth less than it is on the outside."

"It's a nice package, and it's a real set, and it's a quick charge. Okay, though, the computer can't find the source. The charge's a 20-watt charge."
Ask cskh's press if there's any damage.
"Tiki itself from the Jacuzzi restaurant is too comfortable, is now taking the test OK, the charge is less hot and the test is fast, in the long run. How long is it going to take?"
"Don't worry, everyone, it's genuine because we're fucked."
"Tiki delivers it, buys it, buys it, but doesn't have to wait three or four days like other apps, the right thing to describe it, the right code, the full serial number, doesn't know how to store it and check it, but Tiki is relieved."
"Get the price of the satle, okay, well, let's hope that tiki has more code down,"
"Quick delivery, real seal."
"If you're too hot to run with a nanoker, you're gonna switch to this company for security."

"Good stuff, it's not that hot to charge."
sp good
"The package's too hot, it's just warm, it's quick, it's more than an hour and we'll see if we can use the time."
"The first time I bought the accessories on Tiki, but the charge was really fine, and I told Tiki what's wrong with it, and then I asked him if the charge time was running from the battery to less than an hour and a half, and I didn't care much about the maintenance policy, but then he asked him if there was anything wrong with the company, and he said, ""Hey, when the delivery time is later than expected, Tiki should inform the user."""
"Yeah, it's perfect, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good."
It's a quick battery. It's from Tiki.
"The quality view product, no other than the machine-based charge charge. Trusting the tikis, hopefully using their power is okay."
"Apple's main product, Tiki delivers very quickly."
"The real product, the raw product, as described, is quite satisfied, but the delivery is a little bit longer than the expected time, but it's acceptable because it's translating Covid."
"Kbiet check the package but deliver terribly fast, 3 p.m. hrc set 11 p.m. next. Aship cg is enthusiastic!"
It looks good. It looks good.

"The delivery is so fast, it's the day you get it, the box's a bit twisted, it's okay, as long as the company itself is too fast."
"The company itself, raw seal, quality Tiki delivers too long (14 days)"
"Real goods, full stamps, charging for the first time, are pretty fast, the charge's just warm."

"Tiki delivers quickly, the quality of the product is excellent, the price is good."

"Fast delivery, just on the day, the package's intact, so there's no comment yet, but what if the warranty doesn't charge it?"
"The goods, the firms, the charge lines are more stable than the old charged cups."
"It's cheaper outside the store, but the quality of things is okay, it's five stars, and it's fast again."
"The late-night delivery has been ordered, and the next day at noon, the package is packed carefully, properly set, and the price is reasonable."

"I'm so pleased with this product, hunting satin for 384k, tiki wrapped thoroughly, on a cross-cloquist label box, with sephones that look like real stuff. And I'm sure it's buying it through the shopback for another 19k."
No text handles the handle properly. Okay.
"It's cheaper than buying from the fpt, thegioididong or theettelstore."
Great.
"The main charge from the company at vn, purchased by the tikitrading itself for restlessness, charged the battery with three floating charges, which is very dangerous. So it's a 20-watt charge, and it's still a quick charge for the ip11 charge."
"It's actually the tiki countering that never loses its hammock, buys another one for the office..."
"The company's main good, the whole set of goods, the delivery's faster than expected."
"Quick delivery, whole stamps, used two charge times."

"I haven't been able to open my tool box yet, but in terms of the delivery of tikis this time, it's too bad, the electronics that the punchbox is hitting so hard, I'll admit, because I think the charge inside is probably going to be wrapped in plastic shock, who's going to see that naked box that doesn't have any plastic in it, it's going to be a little bit affected by what it's like."
"IQ 12 charges almost two hours is full, one thing is not knowing where to go to check it's the main product, it's the QR code but there's nothing to scan for."
Okay.
Good.
"I don't know, I'm a little worried because checkout no C4H10740390P84T didn't come out on the network."
"I don't know if there's any FPT stamps, so why do you think you're handing over other guys with FPT stamps or who you're complaining about?"
"A delivery to the ground of tiki when the order is not yet received and the package is successful, after the complaint is lost for hours and still has four stars to deliver it in time, the authorities are fine."
"The charge's not hot, the charge's pretty fast."
"Quick delivery, quality goods, steady weight."
"Quick delivery, carefully packed, everything is fine, just waiting to be used to see what's going on."
"Slow delivery is two-and-a-half minutes, set at nine o'clock in the morning, and we'll see about the two-hour delivery."
I hope you're not getting credit for it.
"You received the package this morning, but the QR code and the bar code don't have the information to ask Tiki for help?"
"Buying a product for the first time has failed. Tiki refused to pay for the absence of a box shell, only handles the maintenance for 30 to 60 days, maybe longer."
"I bought a product on June 16, of TIVI walk, and on August 2, 5 months, the charge went unloaded, and I don't know how tiki's maintenance policy for the product is damaged."
Eight days before the last delivery.
Excellent high-quality firm's very good.
The company itself makes good use of it to the present time.
"The foreign product is similar to the description, which is quick to charge, but it's easy to heat up, and it's the main product, and it's too slow to deliver."
"There's no backup, there's no backup."
"Tiki delivers fast, but this sort of break-off box is a little scary."
"It's scratched, TIVA!!!!!"
"Cannot scan the code in the box without a maintainer stamp, currently not used when it is used, it will return to the rating"

Line 7 comes up: “They are hoping that the translator will see it and correct it.
The box inside and outside is distorted. It's pathetic.
"Okay, quick charge. It's a weak package. There's no digital bag. Put it in the paper box."
"It's slow, it's hot, it's not what it's supposed to be."
"Okay, once you feel good, you don't know how, you don't have fpt stamps."

This is the main store. Why don't I check the serial numbers on Shattuck's website?
"The goods are described, the price is right, the price goes up when you want to buy more."
"Order 25/11 was expected to reach 30/11 people who didn't receive it until 2/13, calling Tiki to ask for an apology, waiting for you, putting Tiki again and again, and being so disappointed this time."
Why can't we just scan the QR code on the shell?
It's quick but it's hot. I don't know if long-term products have any effect on the battery.
"It's really good, but it's better than the outside."
I checked the serial number on the web without any information.
Don't you know what a package shop is or a third party intervention?
"Hurry up, pack up. Okay."
"Kcheck is barcoded. K has FPT distribution label, so you don't know if it's a row."

"Long-term transportation, I'll put it for you to charge your phone, which is four days late than expected."
"Two days in advance of 499K, until the day the satle is down to 400K."
How do we know it's fast?
"The package's okay, but the package's been sloppy, and it's been all over the Tiki package, so it's kind of a surprise."
The delivery's been too long. Bad service.
"This order shipper hasn't called in yet that the communication system can't get, delay the delivery date."
You can't hit it fast. Three hours is full.
"Use over a month of damage, have Fpt stamps that don't know how to bring out fpt warranty, or have to bpk over tiki"
It's not coming out. It's checking the ID number.
It's written that tiki k any additional shipper forms that almost destroyed the application
"8 days late, but understanding from the plague, well-loaded."
I didn't get the package. I filed the application.

Nice mouse. Very smooth move. Mr. shipper delivers Tiki very passionately.

"However, the length of your hand still feels that this mouse is small, and your hand will get tired, and hopefully you'll get used to it and get better after that."
"Pack your bags carefully, the products are excellent, the scroll keys are very light, the key is loud and no sound played. The battery comes with alkaline brands, which are new to use, so you can't evaluate the time you use, hopefully OK."

"The delivery is quick, the product is exactly the description."
"After a while of fresh use in writing, expatriates are exactly the same as the description, function is fine, smart and smooth, but it's a loss of a job, it's not 24 months ago, it doesn't go off when Win shut down, it doesn't turn off the hand mouse, it's about a week's battery."
I bought a new one after my ex-size had a left mouse problem after I ran out of warranty.
"The left mouse generates a very large and unpleasant separation while the right mouse is not at fault, very smooth. It is demanding a return."
"Every time you want to connect the blue tooth, you have to close it all over again, not the hot key."
"You don't have to change the size, you should go out and buy it to check the size you need."
"A lot of the time I've been going on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on, trying to figure out how to fix it."
Nice mouse moves gently
"The product cannot be connected, the connection needs never to be maintained."
"Normally, rats are too small, their hands are middle-class women, and they're small, and they're tired of their hands, and they're not good."
Low mouse Dpi.
"Although Followed by Guide, My Hand Is Medium"
"In exchange for no video, there are 600k and complicated packages, never buying online."
"beautiful mouse, smooth use, sometimes unconnected Cid"
"Sensitive mouse handles fit the hand, but the software for customization for each app isn't good enough, it doesn't meet the demand."
"Nice mouse, good use, multiple variables"
It's only been four months since I've bought a two-and-a-half mouse.
"Fast delivery, good advice, fancy goods, free-loading clicks."
"Mouse is small, no mouse sensitivity button"
"Nice mouse, good use, okay."
"Rats are sensitive, smooth, good, smooth."
Soft click
Okay.
"Most carefully packed, the rain doesn't even know if the battery's fast or slow."
That's a good quality product?
"One, the plastic wire should be able to use one time to crack.2 doesn't fit because the plastic leg is a little bit too big, so you have to unplug it to three."
Steadfast and Good

"More than once, you're asking for a refund."
"It's thin, it's easy to miss."
"It's not 12pros, it's not."
"The delivery is exactly as ordered, the Anker cable, the quality needs more time to test it."
"Anker's main product, the form exactly as advertised, fast delivery and packaged goods, will be used and added later reviews."
I'm pretty. I'm fine. I'm a little bit of a mess.
"It's a nice package, Anker's got peace of mind, warranty ok when it's from Tiki."

"The wire is solid and brilliant because there's a man's eye on it, and it's a little long delivered, and now that there's tikinow, it's probably going to be faster."
"Hard-loading head, tight with the device."
I bought the wrong typeC. I didn't know how to trade the wire for iphone k huhu.
"We've got the package, we've got the price, we've got the endurance, we've got the time, we've got five stars, we've got 2 meters."
"We bought tiki now, so the delivery is fast."
Feels good compared to the price.
"Fast delivery, whole set."
"The wire's right on the description. Look on the outside. Okay, let's hope it's sustainable."
It's all right.
"The delivery is pretty fast, the quality is good, it's pretty sustainable, we spend about a year instead of once, it's very fine."
"It's good, but everything can't last, it won't last long."
"The product's good, it's quick, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good."

The Shop is packed carefully delivered quite quickly
"If it's cheap, 200k think the toys everyone's got on their hands are gonna last, hehe."
It's been good for almost a year.
Five-star advance to the Shop for encouragement.
I'm going to support the new store. I'm going to order another one.
It's a pleasure.
"It's cheap, it'shop's passionate advice."
"The first delivery product went wrong, then asked me to change the model for extra money, then deliver the ones I didn't accept, then switch the ones... and then the store said the ones that were sent to the store that I didn't have an error."
It's worth a lot of goods.
Fast delivery is pretty good.
I'm very pleased with the product.
Okay.

"Could not install sim, could not use"
Good stuff.

Satisfaction
"The product is beautiful, the color is beautiful, the long-term use of non-flying wire, the material is very rare, it's fast, but it takes five months to use it one day, fast delivery, fast delivery, fast delivery, bad report, Tiki Care's good."
"If you don't go into the power, no answer from a few days ago, no answer from anybody, no answer from a message, no answer from the profile of the shop check, and you see the exchange rate for 0%, you don't get any reciprocated, you don't pay for it because you think it'll be quality."
I just bought an anker cable and I can't charge it for a minute.
Okay.
"• The good product, the good price, is reasonable. I have spent some time finding great satisfaction. • Fast data transfer rate. The aluminum compound is very strong. • The input design of both USB ports and Type C ports is very convenient for the job : the real package, the neat design, the tight, the fine design. The delivery time is very fast. • FMPTM is a trusted producer in the market, and the product is very good."
There are two USB or TYPE C shifts that are very convenient.
Pretty sure it's a good feed with a light and a flash with a flash drive and TYPE C very convenient.
Very good use. High completion. Very useful.
"You buy two, you buy as much as you can, and that's how bad it is."
"Fast delivery, nice package."
"Okay, file transmission rate isn't as fast as a 3.0 port, it's just a mouse plug with a drawing board and stuff."
"The product's done well, it's light."
"Quick delivery, carefully packed, simple, sophisticated design, convenient use."
It's a good product.
"Cap is beautiful, tiki is very quick to deliver."
"It's neat, it's sharp, it's not like it's high-capacity, so we don't know what it's like."
"Fast delivery, prestige, it's working right now."
There's nothing wrong with the use.
"Quick delivery, steady transmission speed."
Use fine

"Steady, small connection."
It's too smooth.
Fine quality

Q1
OK TOBERT
Shop mail box with no goods
"Nice, easy to use. Use it for mice, keyboards, thermal fans is good, lots of data is hot, it takes a few hours to know how long it's going to last. It's relatively acceptable."
"Small, fast speed, steady transmission."
Two days is a good time.
Wire is too short
"The bass's fine, but the JBL days won't seem so good, but cheaper. Who doesn't need to be neat, just the sound that follows them is the best."
"The sound is sound, there are three buffers that can select the one that's the most earsy, tight, tight, sound-free, well-seted, non-scheduled, long-term traffic. The battery is easy. There are apps on the mobile phone that are used to install it."
"Good headsets, perfect prices, very good bass."
The package's coming back in one piece.
"Great sound quality, good bass"
_Other Organiser
"Nice, bass ok"
That sounds good.
Okay.
"It shouldn't be used while walking, it's the effect of walking that's causing discomfort on the connection between the product and the user's ear."
"The quality of sound when you listen to music is okay, and you get the call back pretty loud on the receiver's side."
"Usually only hear one ear, real bad quality."
"Don't worry, go fast, go two long. Carts on the shop."
It's a thick piece of underwear.
The product's too good. OK.
"The product is clean and clean, however, the surface when the mouse is torn down is sorely that it affects the computer’s performance."
Okay.
"Let's put the grey one, the MUTO one?"
The item was recorded in about three days after purchase.
It's very satisfying to have a hand.usb in the pen and use a 3a battery that's easy to buy. Press the slide very smooth and convenient one.
"The product looks a little bit modern, it's light and neat in its hand. The buttons are stable and laser brightness is strong enough to be used, it's not too bright and it's not too weak."
"I just got the package this morning, and I haven't been connected to the machine yet, but the intuition is off, and it's OK."
"Fast delivery, battery pens, and running, similar to Microsoft Office, fully functional, light-lighted lights, shining 10 meters in office environments."
"Beautiful, sure, clear light, satisfied!"
"The laser's got to hold it in the morning, not the first one in the morning, but it's okay to use it."
"The price of money is not high in the modern world, it's not like Chinese projections often meets at 10 meters, it's in another room, there's only one door open to each other but still works very well, I purposely point to a pen lazer's head, somewhere else in the second room where there's no laptop, and I'm okay. The simple plan is not to mess up, this is very much, because the pen that's so much active, the harder it is to run important events."
"A quick delivery pen, a dress, a leather-baged shop, and an opportunity to support the shop."
"You've got this tree in your hand. The Taki delivery package is off the table. Every time the box holds the whole dictionary that... for the product it's long and long, OK, the button is not heard when you click, however it's more convenient to arrange the buttons, but the way the 4 vertical buttons are, when you switch the buttons, see if you don't know them. This is the first time you use them in your presentation."
"Cheap equipment, pretty fancy handles, neat design, bag packs."
"The product looks OK compared to the price, dubgf takes some time to evaluate the quality."
"Good product, quick delivery."
10 MINUTE DIDN'T HAVE BUT A BITCH
"It's a slightly opposite to the normal log, but it's going to get used to it, and it doesn't matter."
"It's just that pens are a little bit longer than others, but it's very neat because USB heads stick into pens. A good choice for training, presentation."
"Tiki. ""The delivery is fast-faster than the two-day schedule, professional shiper, product is exactly like advertising, tight-helded, well packed, at a price of 195K is reasonable."" Tiki.vk and the trusted supplier."
"It's a little light, but the button sensitivity isn't good, it's a fast delivery that's a slow delivery for a week to deliver, which is 12 days to be delivered."
"The laser beam is quite far away. 8 to 10 meters, calculates the screen switch is fine."
"I've bought it but I've used it once, it's a beautiful machine, it's a wonderful hope!"
"Sp is too good, easy to use, price's okay."
"It's great, it's good and it's good."
Very good.
"Easy, quality unknown, time spent."
"First of all, it's very well packed and sure."
"The pens aren't so sure, but it's so light, the laser can hit a couple of tens of meters, and one more thing is super fast."
"It's like an introduction, a beautiful model, a very convenient bag, a very sensitive press, hoping to last."

"It's pretty good, I think it's good for those who use a lot of presentations, light and convenient enough."
"Notice that when the lights go on, it means the battery's out and you can't operate anymore, so get the battery ready."
The good product I had was a ten-point presentation of kk.
That's exactly what I'm talking about.
"It's good, it's easy to manipulate, it's easy to hold."
Good.
"It's a plastic shell, it's got a hand-held, web-head, it's got magnets in it, so it's not afraid to fall, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, there's also a plastic bag with pens in it."
Standard delivery.
"It's super fast, it's super-sharp, it's super-sharp, it's hot, it's self-medicated, it's good for the price of five stars."
"The product you use is good, people, convenient, included, the HDSD book is in Chinese, so I do my own research, due to import goods, so the delivery time is a little long."
Sp oke. Mm-hmm.
"Use it well, when it comes to batteries, but play/pause node is working."
It's the right delivery. Come on.
"It's coming out of nowhere. It's beautiful, it's small, but I don't know if it's sustainable."
"By the way, nice, sensitive."
"It's extremely sensitive, it's good, it's especially not molded after a long time of use, like other ones with rubber outer layers."
"The good product, just about the money, the only one that's down there is the next button that's not used to it, and it's kind of wrong, but it doesn't matter, the buttons that go up when you click, it's easy to feel."
"Use it. Okay, pen has a key button, so open it before you use it."
"Even if it's cheap, it's fun and it's sensitive."
"Tiki delivers fast, packaged carefully."
"It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay?"

"The products are good for use, the lights are light, the buttons are sensitive, the fancy design."
"Sets the order on January 11,19, and the 14th day is delivered to you. The pen, the sure design, the light, the elegant color. The initial confusion is the function of the two buttons < and >; the beam that shines far away, the rest is fine. The given is a battery."
"It's not too heavy, it's too light, it's too good for a price."
"Convenient and small, I'm extremely pleased to be able to carry these slides with me when I show them."
"I think the pen is actually not as beautiful as the shape, and the push button is not hand-striped, but the pen is short of press, but it's a lot of functions, and I'm pretty happy about the product, and it takes a little time to evaluate it."
"It's beautiful, it's functional."
"It's good use, nice design, good luck, five stars."

The product is good and the pattern is beautiful.
"Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes."
"It's good, it's light, it's economic."
It's beautiful.
"Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up!"
"Small, modern, fairly okay,"
"The product's right, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good."
"Canvas real quick delivery, carefully packed"
It's okay.
"It's good. It's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good."
Good within the price range.
Very good.
Very pleased.
Good.
"Let go, let go, let go, let go, let go, let go, let go, let go, let go, let go, let go, let go, let go, let go, let go, let go, let go, let go, let go, let go, let go, let go, let go, let go, let go, let go, let go, let go, let go, let go, let go, let go, let go!"
The quality fits the price.
"- Got it this morning, earlier than expected -> fun magnets suck usb's head tight. - press hard, push easy. - Hard or not to use some time and then add up --> in general, I'm satisfied."
Take lost magnets. Simple use of basic features.
"The most convenient, easy-to-use design buttons, wide-use range, are USB type C support, but when you click it, it's bigger than the TVtech you're used to. The comparison between price and feature is worth a lot of money."
"The delivery's too fast, 20 orders received by noon 21"
"The pen is carefully held, easy to use, but fairly small laser light shines on unrecognizable television."
The pens show but the lights are visible on the screen. The prices are high but the quality is not the same as the description of disappointment.
"Grabs liquid batteries, design, light, relaxive."
"It's nice, it's easy, it's easy to pick up something that's got a scratch on it."
"Yeah, it looks old. It's been ripped open. I've got a lot of hair on it, but I'll give you a quick delivery, and you'll be fine."
"The pen works well, you can use it right away, but there's no instructions on how to use it, so you have to go to Tiki again."
"I can't control your pens, you can't control them, you can't control them."
"Fast delivery, low-end product, low-intension, low-intensive contours."
No press to play video on slide
Pens are good.
"Good use, but the next slide button is the arrow-shaped button down, so it feels a little backwards, but it's okay."
Pen's good.
It's a waste of TikiNow. It's too slow to deliver.
"The product uses the function OK, but the product needs to be more complete on casing as well as on the paint!"
"Picked up at 8:30-21, took a lunch break and didn't have a laser light on it."
You can't use it anymore.
Okay.
Fine.
with the slide to the horizontal type this doesn't match. 4 stars.
It's relatively okay.
Okay.
"Gavroche, good."
"The regular product, sent like a long time ago, didn't see any warranty."
"Not happy, weak lasers, plastic shells, not aluminum, looking at the wrong shape."
"It's okay, but I'm sorry it's battery-free."
Very OK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Fine.
Hold on tight. The pattern is very permissible. There's only a weak spot. There's no switch off the slide.
"It's easy to use, it looks nice, but the pen shell is plastic, not metal like you think!"
Okay.
"A product like advertising, quite satisfied."
Requested Outputs

"SP's a little old, scratched."
It's fine.
"The product is good compared to the price of sale, which is equal to the large radius"
"It's the right image, it's the right quality, it's the good TiKi service."
The battery cap's a little loose.
"Packed carefully, sp is like an ad."
"The pen's fine, the click's a bit loud."
"It's beautiful, it's small, it's reasonable, it's going to continue to support Tiki."
Sp at a fair price.
Quality waits time to use.
Standby.
"It's quite surprising that I've had a malfunction before, and now I've got this little mouse because of its smoothness, and the mouse is running smooth on many surfaces, and the click is smooth and there's no sound, and the mouse is smaller than I like, but it's not a problem, it's just an open, incomplete box shell, but the battery and everything is full."
"The mouse is very smooth, the quality is different, this is the silent so press it doesn't listen to the separation and the light isn't lit."
Rats run smoothly and use them very well.
"I'm a student, so when I choose the mouse, I have to think about the price and the quality."
"THE quick delivery, carefully packed, carefully packed mouse product is good, sensitive, especially quiet and smooth clicks. Mouse has invisible lights at the bottom, many people don't notice that mice don't work."
"I've got a red one, and this time I've got a black one for you."
"The mouse is small, the click is quiet, the envelope is solid, the mouse seems to glide easier and more accurately on the surface like a wooden table."
"• Fast delivery by Tiki: Set Thursdays, which have a package (normal), which is carefully packed. • Quality: Sensible Mouse, which is smooth. When clicking is not noise, it is also available when it is purchased with a battery (AAA) inside."
"The mouse click will be a little bit harder. The mouse click will be a little bit more noisy. It'll be a little harder to get used to it, but then it'll be a lot more like it. The black version won't be blacker, but it'll be grey. The robot design is not red. The basic style. It's very reasonable to use soft (not gamer). It's a good thing to do. Use 1. The laser scan engine does not see the light (no red light in its eyes.)"
"Right, first of all, next time we're on drugs, we're on our hands!"
Okay.
"Quick delivery, smooth mouse, sensitive click. Good mouse"
"The silent mouse mouse line is a favorite, very smooth click, which does not make any noise; the roll is comfortable, there are no loosely shaken signs; it's very appropriate for you to use the mouse at night that doesn't want to affect your roommate, or use it in your office to avoid noise to your colleagues. The total of these four lines, the three in Tiki, are very pleased."
"Soft, sensitive mouse. puts web on your computer while you wait to get installed before you start running. Turn on the source. Turn on the light, like any other mouse thinks it's dead, you're going to call tiki to change another one."
"Now that the mouse is running well, we don't know how to do this... fast delivery, save the net in time."
"The mouse is smooth, the sound is small when you click, but when you roll the mouse, the price is good, the delivery time is fast, number three, number five is received, there's no idea how long it's going to last, and the maintenance is good."
"The mouse is so small, it's so smooth, it doesn't sound like a mouse click, it's all outside the feeling that it's gone and it's all together, it's brand new, it's not scratchy, it's all right, everybody should buy it."
"Fast delivery, well packed, good quality, more product from the shop to support it."
The product is good.
"Many of you say the mouse roll is a bit loud, and you probably used a roll to not break it, so it's normal for you to feel that sometimes it feels better, but I don’t like it “to be perfect, toohehee."
"Small mouse, shorthand, low cost that's the best use in the cheapest flow of logs."
"I've always used a Guccitech-free mouse, which I like very much."
"The new product, with the stamp of Wing Chun importing unit, delivered every day (12h), received the package. The full TlIP menu! The original product uses the correct estimate line for click mouse, scroll is louder than click mouse."
"A little loud as you roll the mouse, and if you roll the mouse, it'll be great if you roll the mouse like a mouse in the right."
"It was bought three years ago, and now it's written evaluations, and it's really good for a person who hates the break-in of a mouse because it's what it's called, it's not making any noise. <i>Clinch is too familiar with computer mouse products and should be off the table for three years and then just replace the two batteries even though we use a lot of the mouse and always forget to turn off the mouse every time we use it.</i> <i>I feel super persistent with a guy like me.</i> <i>I'm gonna be fine.</i> <i>I'm gonna be fine.</i> <i> <i>I'm gonna be fine.</i> <i>I'm gonna be okay.</i> <i>I'm gonna be okay.</i>I'm gonna be okay.</i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i>I'm gonna be okay.</i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i>I'm</i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i>I'm> <i>I'm sorry.</i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i>I's</i> <i>I's a lot.</i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i>I' <i>I's a lot.</i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i>I'I'I'I'I'I'I'I' I' I's"
"A wonderful product from Logotech! Cheap, sophisticated design, sensitive mouse, click and roll don't listen;) The battery was just purchased, so I'm not sure I'll be able to use 18 months as an introduction."
It's extremely satisfying.
"The perfect design, which fits your hand, is especially smooth, left or right mouse clicks are not heard. It is appropriate for office environments, and you like silence. A stable connection is not lost, as is your old mouse. With 1000 dpi parameters, the mouse is very smooth, the operations are very gentle, and this is the mouse you should refer to."
"Let's use it once in a while, let's say Tiki delivers it quickly, and the mouse is smooth, and it doesn't make any noise when it's used, and it's generally okay with office tasks like mh, and it's weak: it's smooth on the mouse pad, and the rest of it's okay."
"OK, sp. On/off buttons alone are not as convenient as the old sp line"
"Very fast delivery, packed in carton cans carefully."
"Fast delivery, sensitive mice, time later don't know what's going to happen, but right now it's okay."
"The Logotech mouse has been in use for over a week. Press the sound very small. Mouse, I don't need to use a mouse pad, but I'm going to put the mouse's location exactly. I'm pretty good with this mouse."
"The mouse is soft, sensitive, and this is SILEN so you don't hear mouse clicks."
"It's pretty good. It's either a little loose or a good deal. At the price of the money, it's okay."
"Nice, sensitive day."
"Mouse is a little small for the hand but it's still very sensitive but it's not as sensitive as the light that comes from 1200dpi, which is only 1000dpi, so it's not equal to right, because it's limited to the dark surface, so it's not as sensitive as the light."
"After more than two months of using it, let's have a couple of comments like this. The first feeling is that mice have a pretty nice shape, and when they're holding them in their hands, they're very nice, they're very smooth, they're very smooth, even though they don't need a mouse."
"It's 214K, and it's free now. It's very quick delivery. Two weeks of good use. It's going to be good."
"The good stuff is fast, good and smooth."
The delivery is on schedule. Pack it carefully.
"Rats are good, sensitive, soft clicks, and especially they're not afraid of cats!!!!!!"
"Rats used well, fast speed doesn't make a sound, stamps are stored out of the shell, they don't cut into the inside, they're pretty black, they're crashing with their laptops."
"Rats are sensitive, they're cheap, clicks are pretty smooth, they're generally good for logs."
"I'm so impressed with Logotech, buying a second one, but it's a different one, but it's a different one."
Okay.
"It's easy. It's neat. It's especially not noisy to work in a quiet environment. Maybe a lot of people don't get used to it, because rats are smaller than normal mice, but when they're used to it, it's very flexible."
"Move the mouse smooth, smooth, good looking"
"Close your bags carefully, with the same colors, the same colors, the smooth, the smooth, the best-looking mouse in your life, the first mouse to buy it, but it's incredibly satisfying."
"I've bought, I've spent a few months very well, if you're looking for rats at this price, pick this one right here."
"He's been using this girl for two and a half months to come up with a comment, and the size is so smooth, the mouse clicks are barely making any noise, and the weak point is that when you're standing about two and a half feet from a distance, you lose the signal, in general, it's only appropriate to get on the button, but you shouldn't, it't be disappointing."
Use it well.
"Light press, quick delivery, very good Alkaline battery."
"Also look at the reviews of the mice, and now they're doing pretty well, and there's nothing in their looks that's too dominant, but the feedback is pretty good."
"Quick delivery, good package, good quality worth price"
"The package is intact, not torn, with the distribution stamp on the box shell. The left-right key is smooth but the middle roll is still noisy. The black is pretty nice, almost like the color of his laptop."
"Fast delivered mice, fairly sensitive, satisfied with sp"
"Nice, soft press, no click clicks. Red, fancy look. Tiki delivers fast delivery."
"Soft, smooth, beautiful mouse move"
"I've only been using it since yesterday, and I've found it's okay, and it's light, and it's good, and it's good."
Rats are good at the price.
"The product has enough warranty stamps. Use it pretty well. Okay, tiki delivery is a bit late for the FOXO delay."
"The product is exactly the introduction: smooth, small, no noise and quite sensitive"
"The first time I bought the expensive mouse was a bit of a fit, but it was a smooth one."
"Okay, okay. The stop button is loud. The price of an office. Okay, let's play a game."
"Very smooth and delicious mouse, fast delivery, nice package, proper product."
"Quick delivery, correct description of the product."
"mouse is the correct pattern, such as the image, using like, sensitivity, soft click, soft voice. Please"
"Main product, smooth buttons, quick delivery."
"The mice are smooth, fit. Five stars."
Okay.
Nice color. Your mouse.
"Okay, let's make it a year, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go!"
"Pretty, the click doesn't make a sound. It's very satisfying."
"The delivery time is pretty fast, packing goods, mice use goods, main goods, raw seals"
"It's extremely satisfying, the silent mouse, using the name light, doesn't make any noise every time you click a mouse, selects TikiNow, delivers very quickly, Highly recommend!"
"It's good. It's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good."
OK.
It's a good piece of good stuff.
"Em, light, smooth"
"Quick delivery, nice stuff."
"The mouse was clean, and it didn’t listen to the noise, and it didn’t break down, and it didn’t break down for about four months, because the first green baby used it well, so he had to buy a red baby to give it to his mother."
"+ Set the order the other day, Tiki delivered the package the next day. + Mouse is smooth, no noise, batteries.5*"
The product is exactly like advertising.
"Tiki delivers fast, well packed, and this mouse has nothing to worry about."
Goodshop rats don't have anything to complain about.
"A super-strong rat, using super smooth clicks, doesn't make a big sound, once drops one-meter from the table and doesn't break."
"The mouse runs smoothly, very sensitively, and it runs across the bright white table (not the underline), the size of the woman’s hand or the person with the small hand."
"Good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good!"
It's good to use.
Mouse smooth and smooth
"Have a good time, guys!"
"The product's good, the log's good, and there's no complaints."
Rat clicks don't make any noise.
Okay.
Where is this rat product in the north?
"Small, neat, reasonable price."
"You've just opened your hand, you can't use it, you can't stop it. OK, you can hold it, you can't touch it, you can't move it, you can't move it, you can't move it, you can move it, you can move it, you can move it, you can move it, you can move it, you can move it, okay?"
"The click is very smooth, the price is fair."
"I bought this one, I bought it for the third one, I brought it back when I was moving."
"Buy for CTY, so there's no picture. And if you're ready, you're going to continue to support the shop."
It's gonna be okay.
"Good product, very smooth press, delivery guaranteed on schedule."
"Rats are so good, they're smooth, they're good, they're good, they're good, they're good, they're good, they're good, they're good, they're good, they're good, they're good, they're good, they're good, they're good, they're good, they're good, they're good, they're good, they're good, they're clear, that're the reason they always choose tiki, not bad."
"If you choose again, you will select a smaller than the one held in your hand, selecting a lamp so that it will not be forgotten."
"Tiki delivers quickly, always supporting tiki."
"It's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good."
"The delivery is fast, the delivery is a little tight, the mouse is fast, the mouse click is not listening."
"I used to use the Logotech mouse, but this is the first time I've got a very light, so sensitive, so smooth."
"The beauty of the product, the neat design, the use of the mouse, is familiar, and now it's quiet to use it."
It's the third time you've bought it.
"Rats are soft and light, women fit, hand-held, high-sensitivity."
"Quick delivery, nice ones."
Very pleased.
"Packing up the product a little sketchy. Most of it's not guilty of anything. Every mouse's roll is a little bit twisted to the right. It's basically a good product. It's good, it's good, it's good."
"It's been a long time, it's been a half a year since October, it's not dead, it's cool!"
"The delivery was extremely fast, booked the evening that the next morning, the quality was probably fine within the price range."
The red mouse is the same M221 that we bought a year ago. The blue mouse is today.
"The real mouse, Tiki's passionate support, and I was wondering about Tiki's product that called me right after 30 minutes."
Okay.
"Quality product, quick delivery"
"The mouse clicks are very smooth, although it's a little strange to be used at first, but it doesn't matter after a few days, holding a hand, if anyone's got a little bit bigger, I think it's a little bit harder."
"Okay, that's good."
"It's a smooth mouse, no sound, but it's still high, it's sustainable, it's worth the price."
"The delivery is quick, the product is exactly the same as the new purchase description, so we don't know what quality it takes to find out how much time it takes to use it."
"It's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice."
No sound keys at all
"It's generally good, it's light, it's soft, it's tight, it's small, it's nice to hold, it's good to hold it, it's time to evaluate it."
"It's only down 90 percent of the noise, but it's good. The battery doesn't have any hope for more than a year."
It's worth a lot of money.
"The mouse works, the click doesn't make noise, I use it for work, I don't play the game, so I'm fine."
"The delivery was pretty fast, but shield was taken off and glued in."
"Borrow, smooth, beautiful"
Handsome.
"Your key, sensitive, quite fine."
They're distributed by digiworld. They're very pleased.
"The mouse is smooth, and it's very smooth, and it doesn't make noise, and it's beautiful blue."
Good.
Quality Quality
"When I first got the battery back, I didn't see the battery with the flash drive. <i>I didn't think it was enough to see the battery with the USB flash drive.</i> <i>It's convenient if you want to bring the mouse around.</i> <i>I'm only buying this so that when I play the game doesn't affect the sleeper.</i> <i>and see okay.</i>"
"A small mouse with a soft touch, and a large hand buys an M330/331 line that's more suitable."
"Use it well!!!!! Mouse used to glide the web gently, inappropriately for other things such as playing games and working on graphics??"
"Rats have a small size for girls, they're a little small for men, they're so sensitive, they're smooth, they're not click-free, I'm most pleased at this point."
Just wondering why the lights aren't lit.
The mouse is so smooth.
"The quality of the product is good, firm hand, light, soft, sensitive button, pretty smooth roll button."
"I'VE EXPLAINDED THE PORTRIES OF THE TYBILIES OF THE SIBILIES OF THE SIBILIES OF THE NUMBER, I'VE DIBERED THE PORTRACE OF THE PORTUGHS OF THE PORTHS OF 2 BITALS AND SERVES OF THE PORTRACES AND SERVES OF THE BROST OF THE BRONTS (SIVAL LIVAL LIVAL LIVAL LIVALMENTS), IN THE BORS OF THE PORTS OF THE PORTS OF THE PORT OF THE PORT OF THE PORTS OF THE PORTS OF THE PORT OF THE PORTS OF THE PORT OF THE PORT OF THE PORT."
Good Use
"New use, now very well, the mouse is smooth and firm handle"
"Tiki delivers fast, the product is exactly what it looks like, satisfied with Tiki."
"It's very smooth, it doesn't make any noise, it's little, it's easy to grasp, and the girls use it very well."
"The price on Tiki is cheaper than at a store, and the mouse uses smooth, sensitive, easy to install."
"The little mouse clicks nice, but you're not doing very well with your grip. It's a little uncomfortable, but it's okay to spend it at night."
"Only spent a few days. Preliminary remarks are left keys and have to press light and smooth, the scroll wheel in the middle is not as smooth but is still acceptable. The price is reasonable. Tiki delivers very quickly (in Hanoi, less than 24 hours from the order)."
"The quality of the good product, the light mouse, the smooth press, the passionate delivery officer, I'm satisfied with the product."
"The mouse is very good, very smooth, and no noise. It'll introduce you more support."
"You don't hear clicks, it's good to use them at lunch."
"The delivery is fast, the button is okay."
"Make quick delivery, the product works!"
"Got the package. It looks a lot like an unusable picture, but it looks like it's very satisfying."
"The package's already out, but it's the supply. People pull out for warranty. It's a 100 percent price."
"The good stuff, each battery cap is a bit loose, but it doesn't affect too much."
"It's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good."
It's okay.
Okay.
"The skewed mouse has never let himself down, clicking without being heard, sustainable mouse, this is his second mouse."
Good.
Okay.
The computer has already turned on ON and web is still off the light. Is it the manufacturer's fault?
"The mouse is quiet, it's soft, it's steady, it's holding the battery for a long time, there's no annoying light."
Good.
It's easy to buy this sp 2 times.
"You know, if you click right, click click, you may not like it right away, but if you use a lot of it, it's normal. Press still has a sound but it's small and it's not bright."
Quick delivery.
"Beautiful, neat, very soft clicks, don't make noises like generations like M175, 185"
"Fast delivery, reservation at 2:30, brand new package."
Okay.
"Rats use quiet, quiet, they're not too loud, they're watching more."
"It's okay. It's okay, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good."
Good.
Quick delivery. That's right. Two hours. The product looks like a description.
"The mouse is smooth, the press is soft, it's not loud, it's very happy."
Use it fine.
"Good mouse, when you click, don't move, keep quiet, don't affect other people."
"Buy the first time I've seen a round stamp. I'll never see it again, but I'll be fine."
"Using it very handy, trusted delivery despite changing the delivery address"
It's been half a year since Tiki's reported.
"I've been using it for days, and I don't see any mistakes."
Soft Press Mouse
"The mouse is quiet, quiet, and fine on all terrain. However, the mouse rolls out a bit of a noise, and the switch off button is a bit difficult to use."
"It's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good."
Okay.
"Beautiful, quality, reasonable price."
"Okay, easy click, soft and sensitive."
"Slight, sensitive, neat-looking rat. It's worth it."
It's okay. It's all right. It's all right. It's all right. It's all right.
It's not an error for a mouse to use okee at all but it's a good thing for a brother or a night owl like me.
"It still feels like other clicks, queen weights, and so on, but it doesn't make clicks when you click, you don't get used to it because you click or not, generally it's a great product at average."
"It's not a good use for office, it's not a good fit to play games, but still, I'm a regular pubg."
"Feelings that fit, do not make any noise, are appropriate for those of you who work at night and don't want to bother others."

"Yesterday's package, from Tiki Trading, had Digiworld stamps on its shell, a series code on the mouse with an unmatched package, a slightly loose battery cap, while moving mice a little bit."
"The delivery is on schedule, the product is prime, but the battery caps aren't tight, making noise every time it comes in."
"I don't know how to handle it, but this company has three of them, and it's okay, thank you tiki for the quick delivery policy, and I like to buy them, and I'll always be loyal to tiki."
"The good product, which is very satisfying, the mouse clicks lightly. If you can move on every terrain, then fine. Next time, you'll continue to support the shop."
"The mouse's S/N number doesn't match the box. The box has been removed. It looks like the store's unscrambled for mass flow. Shop needs to learn. The product looks new but has a scratch on it. Thank you, off seems to be loose."
The package was removed and pasted to be delivered to the guests and inside used by the mouse because of a tape marks on the mouse’s foot.
"Package received. The quick delivery ordered last night that was received this afternoon. Feeling about the two buttons was smooth, the mouse felt unscramble, the roll-off button didn't work. There was no tape on the mouse with just the DIWORL stamp on the shell."
"I just bought a mouse in March, and it was quiet and there was no noise, but lately I didn't get a signal or a battery that was weak, and I don't know why I had to put it back together or tear it down a dozen times before it got dizzy."
"The mouse delivers at the right time, but when it's used, there's no sign of activity. <i>There's no signal changing another battery.</i> <i>You know, if you're in touch with the customer, if the new producer's error changes another one.</i> <i>When Tiki thinks that relatives buy on Tiki, it's too free to destroy the mouse to be changed?</i>"
"The new mouse set out a little bit to post the warranty stamp, but the warranty check check for April 22, 2020."
"I've got the onions, I've got the shop, I've got the manifests and I've got the shipping agents pretty fast, and I've got notes that's incredibly fragile, so Mr. shipper keeps the order up and down and down, and I'm sure, clicking without any noise, but the roll button has a sound."
"Take 12/2018, so far two years and two months."
"Buy two green and red mice, no red mice, offer Tiki support for the product"
"The goods for the silent go to pieces, demand to return the goods, wait for the month's end, the goods are returned, and the money is not paid."
"The mouse line is just the word Logo, which is quite smooth in hand."
"Here's the number of purchases from tiki that were delivered by a quick delivery unit, received that the package outside of the package wanted to be shut down. The package is not as sure as it used to be. Ask the delivery staff said it was in a small package, but it was to warn the delivery unit that they were fast, so let's not buy tiki from now on."
"This mouse that I bought from TIVI TIVING. The mouse that I got off the hands: 1, the dirty envelope, the dust of two. Mouse that's available on 3. Buys April 3, but the warranty from February 2020.</i> <i>I don't know how many people I've gone through before. <i>It's very unhappy for this delivery of tiki! <i> Before buying something that's too important, there's been a double scratch, but it's not acceptable.</i> <i>It's important for everyone to select the small people to use blue to get a new mouse, not to be like themselves.</i>"
"I used it to pick up a little bit of surface from a B1-0K with a wire on it, but anyway, buying logs is more secure than other mice at a price they used to use."
"The key key's pretty good, but it's not as sensitive as the g304 is using a little bit of regret."
"The product that's fresh, brand new, it's stable, but it's long gone by, because some of the details aren't going well, it's a little loose, like the lids on the bottom and two mouse panels, which, besides the roll, it's choking, and it's a little uncomfortable."
"However, the response of the mouse was quite slow and the underside of the mouse was sometimes scratched when the box was removed!"
"The mouse clicks smoothly. It's long stored, so it's kind of dusty."
"As soon as the mouse was received, the mouse was not as smooth as the description. The two buttons, instead of the separation, called out quite a bit (a little lower than the split call), the roll was as loud as any other. If you need quiet, you shouldn't buy it. It's a bit disappointing."
"The mouse's fine, but can I ask if the mouse has a light? I see a light, but why don't you just blink, so even though the battery's turned on? Is this a rat problem?"
"The product isn't exactly the same as the picture, it's very slow."
"Fast delivery, but we check the S/N code on the mouse and the box is not the same code."
"Mouse is fine, the silent button should press no noise, likes this point very much. However, this mouse has a problem with the middle mouse button, using the time it takes to press the mouse button in between when it's hard to roll, I buy both of them."
"If you don't use it, you don't know how good rats are, but the box's already open, so it's not good enough."
"I used to use an M187 for two years, and I'd like to think that M225 numbers bigger than M187 would be better to buy, but it's not."
"The two-year combination of keys has to be out of use, so we've had to change batteries about two or two times in the process."
"When you've ordered it, you'll have to roll, call the bouncer, ask him if he'll pay for it, tell him not to know, and then wait a month."
"Opens the box and sees your personal wrapper, mouse, what is the purpose of the wrapper here?"
"Why is it that the mouse I bought in Tiki doesn't have a seal or a receipt, so how can I preserve it later?"
"I used to buy one of these codes and use them very well for three years, but this mouse doesn't know if it's a mistake, but most of the time I can't control it."
"The next two days will be delivered every week without notice, and the mouse will never run again, and the money will never be found."
"I think Tiki has a habit of opening the previous product, as mentioned in the previous Tiki product, shouldn't do that."
"I got it every day, October 13,20, but the warranty stamp was marked from June, and the mouse at the time delivered at the time of the ON button was turned on, and the number S/N on the mouse stem and the box shell didn't match."
Shop today opens for use but the rats don't run.
"It's standard, but the strength of the S matter is low, and sometimes the sensors are slighted, patting the normal back."
"The product's very popular, it's fast, it's 2 new ones a few days ago, it's 249K each, it's 498K and it's down to 199K each."
"I read the description of using soft mouse, not making noise, but left mouse, right mouse, and a roll, which is really loud."
There's no flash drive left in the computer.
It's okay to see the quality of logi coming down first.
"Seeing the third delivery press, which the second has already received, prepares the money, doesn't make it: rats can't use them well, they can't make a sound, they can't make a sound."
"Quality OK. Press does not make noise, does not weigh the ear, does not feel comfortable except grab the battery."
"Buying and spending five months in a row, high-use frequency, high-tech and graphic drawing, and still good, not running out of batteries. However: Only good use on flat surfaces (except glass), but putting on thigh or other positions is not good."
Mouse is small and should only fit the object with small arms or so. The relative quality of the quality is not known if sp is more sustainable than M331 (long-term use is pressed button)
"It's true, the silent, the press won't make a sound, but the roll is loud, and the battery's a little heavy, except for the ""silent"" point, everything is less than an M187."
"This is the second one I've bought, the kind of noise reduction, but this one's still too noisy, and the new one's still getting the old mouse."
"The product looks very dirty and old, like a long-term display or storage store."
"Good speed, but this one's not on the glass."
"Mouse handles OK, 2 plastic notes are scratched, as used, reei on the mouse and the top is not identical."
"And the fact that the mouse received the battery, worked, the computer got it right, the mouse was so smooth, I don't know if there's any difference to the gamer."
I don't know if there's any noise in everyone's purchases.
"The delivery is a little slower than expected. Even though it's tiki now, the new mouse has opened the warranty box, and it's wrong to use it as normal as the description."
"Using more than 3 months, there is a problem: If you want to click left mouse, the pressure is strong or click twice. When you first bought something like this, you don't know what caused it?"
"The mouse is small and light, and it doesn't hold it very well even though it's small; the quality of the mouse is good, the click is very smooth, and the clicks have to be close to the ear."
Why don't you have an electronic bill?
The package is exactly the same as the image.
"I'm putting in quick delivery, I'm making calls, I'm making calls. It's too slow. I haven't had a mouse in days. I'm very disappointed."
"The battery cap doesn't match, the rat's torn to pieces, it's very uncomfortable, it's even worse than buying a boat rat."
"When it comes to external products, such as keyboards, mice, and computer speakers, most certainly everyone knows about the Albrechttech label. I wonder whether there's always a Party version or the Doodles of the Gyptico that are much more likely to be more expensive than 20k, but after thinking about it, I choose this one for two reasons: one is a mouse that doesn't make any noise in clicks and two is a high usage of batteries (18). Before, there's very little mistake."
"For more than a week, in the configuration of the type on win 10 that doesn't seem to be very sensitive on the table. Tiki delivers fast, plus 5k more money when he delivers this thing, because the receipt says there's 250K. On the back side: you should buy a mouse that's more than 500k to see if it's more favorable than this one."
"The delivery was faster than expected, the button was smooth, but the pressure was a bit shallow, and the mouse was small."
"The product's gone. The carton box outside the delivery, it's disfigured, it's post-sympathetic."
"The left mouse goes right to the top to eat, the mouse rolls a little bit, rolls over the genius 170k mouse."
Rats are small compared to me. Click it very smoothly.
"The product buys May 2020, but the warranty stamp is April 2020, so minus one."
Use it at a price range.
It's been two weeks since we bought it.
"The price's good, the color's good, the quality's good."
The delivery is an old mouse.The serial code on the mouse and the shell has certainly been used because rats have been scratched as well.
"When I get the product, I try to use it right away, and this is my feeling: -- Mouse gets it right when you put a signal in the port web laptop."
There's been a change of delivery schedule (two hours cannot be delivered in two hours) and slow (second than Friday) compared to the expected delivery schedule.
Mouse does not noise but is too sensitive to fit but is appropriate for people at work
"Rats fail, we have to replace a new one every two days. AA, how's the warranty time?"
I'm fine.
A small click ok You're worse off than genius before 100k is in use I don't know if I'm using the 1200dpi gene and I'm turning to this one 1000dpi so I don't know whether or not the cursor is distorted or not
"It's all about getting the image confused so the consumer gets enough, and it's too much for the feeling of being fucked."
"Matching the description, there's only a tiny mouse (or maybe it's his hand to :v)"
"Do you prefer the split-click mouse? This mouse is smooth, no noise."
Can I ask you a mouse that doesn't have a web receiver with it?
"Just bought it at 229K, and it felt like the mouse was at first pretty good, right hand, no left cry, right, there was still a cry in the middle of the roll."
"The goods are smooth, light, soft clicks don't listen, tịki now deliver fast"
"It's good stuff, it's soft, it's soft, it's very loud, it's loud, it's loud, it's four stars."
"After two months of protective use, the mouse has been damaged on the left. The maintainer needs support."
"The mouse is smooth, snaged, but the wheelchair feels a little dry, rolled down, not as smooth as the other mice we've been using."
"The product is OK for people who aren't too hard to deal with, fast delivery, four stars for what it's like to hold a mouse a little light compared to what you want."
"The quality... clicks and rolls don't make any noise, but the mouse shape is a little small, and it's uncomfortable to have a mouse in it."
"Rats are quiet, quiet doesn't make noise, sometimes not sensitive."
"Quick delivery, friendly delivery, light, smooth mouse, but the lights are not lit."
"Mouse is not as sensitive as introduction, time meets over cham, quality over bad, offers a recovery of sp"
"It's fine within the price range, but the grip doesn't feel right, it's the material."
"The left mouse clicks it over and over and over again. It doesn't cry as much as other mice do; it's using a few days of error, sometimes it has to hit two or two times."
"Rats are sensitive. However it's not silent, but it still hears the right click"
"It's not much bigger than expected, it's better for the smaller hand."
"I've bought this one twice, but it's different than once, Tiki lets me ask if I want to trade it back, ntn."
"Rats are smooth, they lose a little sensitivity for about a year, but they're satisfied with this price."
"The first feeling is that the mouse is very smooth, and it's a little light for the person to hold it, because it used to be heavier, so now it's OK 8/10, except the battery isn't very happy, it's not going to be long."
It's okay. It's okay.
"There's an opening in the cap, needs to change the product."
"The super-smooth clicks may at first be unfamiliar but may become more popular. Tiki delivers too long, the address at Q3 that 10 days later is equal to="
mouse when used why there's no lights on despite having turned on.
This one's on it.
"Rats are fine, no noise, because it's urgent to order tiki now, and it takes five hours to get it."
"It's pretty good. If you're low on computers, you're good to go."
"The mouse has two left clicks which are fine, which sound good, but the scroll is too loud, and the extra amount of money for the M331 seems to be a lot better."
"The mouse's fine, it's still good, but when it comes back, the lights are gone."
"+ Sensitive, small, sustainable + There's a reduced click sound but it's not completely sient"
They're all sensitive. The mouse's too smooth.
"The product's soft, it's loud, but there's no preservative stamp for the product."
"I bought three products, and now there's a product that doesn't work."
"The package product is carefully packed, the battery is available."
"Tiki delivers as quickly as possible (a three - day calendar) Rat review is good, clicks very small, but still feels good, the weakness is that the mouse roll is not very smooth, and the battery cap is a little loose, and it's a little bit more satisfied with sp."
"Used for macbooks very jerky, inappropriate"
"The mouse click is pretty smooth, no noise. Mouse is sensitive. Cons: scroll wheel is not very smooth."
"Rats are fine, even if they fall many times, but they're still sensitive, and they don't change the key to gumlent rats."
I just bought a mouse. Why do I turn it on and it still doesn't light up?
"Fast-handed, light, smooth clicking, no more annoying mouse click sounds, so there's a mouse pad or run on the dark color surface."
"I bought a black one, everything but a roll button. The scroll is louder and bigger for the normal version of this mouse."
"Small, easy-to-use mice, no noise, quite beautiful red."
"You get another one, no shop, you buy less than three months of the rat's jumping."
"Slowly, feel good use"
"Rats are okay, but without stamps, what do you say?"
"Fastship, smooth mouse. The battery assembly's even closer to five."
"Small, easy to handle, the buttons are very smooth, the delay is low, but the motion is inaccurate, very uncomfortable."
"Posting stamps is like refusing warranty, telling me how to maintain three years and then stamping."
"The old package is open, there's no original delivery, only when it's taken out."
"I'm impressed with Tiki's service: order, deliver."
"Smaller than my hands, I'm tired."
Color and shape OK but press and pull up are not smooth.
I can't hold it very well.
"The product's good, the mouse's not hearing, the mouse's roll's loud."
"I've known so many times that it's not true, but it's the most important thing I've ever seen in my life, and it's the first time I've ever had in my life."
The middle mouse's broken!
It's okay. It's appropriate that you do the office or the simple cv.
"The mouse uses an infrared port with a light on it, but the mouse delivers a damaged lamp."
The product works.
"My mouse is about turning on the light, not running."
"The mouse clicks smoothly but the wheelchair is not cool, the child’s call is like an oil - dry car."
why is the mouse lamp not lit? @info
"Left mouse, right smooth, but you're too loud, you don't like it."
laggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggg
"Since getting the product so far, everything's fine, rats don't make noise."
"The mouse was used for a week when the scroll bar was short, and the mouse was one week old when the scroll bar went off."
"It's very good, but if the price goes down, it'll be a lot more exciting."
It's been a few days since the purchase of a mouse.
"Rats use ok but the plastic envelopes are cut off, not intact"
"The package is packed carefully, the quiet button is good for the night, but the mouse scroll is bigger than click, which does not come with the warranty coupons, so it's probably a stamp on the product."
"Close your eyes, standard cargo required."
"The mouse's gone a little too far upstairs, but it's been a long time since I've known you."
The good product is within price range.
"Sometimes you get a mouse standing, tiki sees a new warranty."
The mouse is good for the price of a buffalo battery.
"Rats are good, fast delivery, carefully packed."
"Nice, quick delivery."
"Sensitive, smooth mouse. Quality OK."
"Left mouse and right are pretty good, no noise, but the click is pretty loud."
mouse is small compared to adult hands
"It's a very good battery, my friend."
"The temporary products are fine, the wheels are a bit loud and not very smooth."
"New mouse is not scratched, friendly delivery"
"Two left and right mouse buttons, but the mouse roll is quite loud."
"It doesn't make any noise when it's used, but it's not going to fit anyone with big hands because mice are small, they're going to spend a little bit of time getting used to."
"It's not a good thing to do it, but the lights aren't lit."
It's 228k and 204k.
That's the line.
It's okay.
"A small, beautiful, but short-term mouse has been dead for a month and is no longer in use."
enabled
"You roll so loud, you're not so sensitive, for three stars."
Okay.
"Beautiful, fast, colorful pattern used very much"
"Buy it for me, so I don't know what the quality is."
"Rats are a little small, we'll use them again. Okay."
It's a sweet touch. It's worth the money.
How could I miss a flash drive?
Shut up:-)
I've been waiting two days for delivery.
There's no flickering lights on it.
"Can't move on the glass table, can only be on the light wooden table or dark."
Good.
Good use will buy more if necessary
- Put me on the white wood floor.
ok kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk
"The product is quite smooth, the click is small, it's available on many surfaces, it's low on batteries, I've spent more than six months and the battery has not gone down much."
"Happy, sensitive, smooth mouse!"
It's a smooth mouse.
It's very funny.
It's good.
"Designs that fit in their hands, the spikes are good, and especially the clicks that are so smooth, that are good for working late in the room does not affect others."
"So this sp is good, it's sensitive, it's easy to design, it's good for your office, it's sv. And the players should use other mice."
"The sensibility mouse clicks doesn't sound, the mouse feet are a bit soft."
"The mouse bought three months ago, the wheelchair broke. The quality fits the price. The package delivery is good."
"Big hands don't buy, big m331, big ones like z."
"The quality of the peacock doesn't match the price of the money, it doesn't feel smooth."
"For they are but small in comparison with the man of a large hand, as though he were........"
Chuot turns out I'm fine with an eight-year-old test.
SUCCESSED TO UNDERSTAND A ENJOY OF THE DIFFERENT DIFFERENT DIFFERENT
"Rats use well, but slightly small, if someone's got big hands, they should consider it."
"Mouse is not as smooth as advertising, the roll is still louder and louder than the click of a mouse."
Good.
"Everything's okay, but a little bigger size fits the boys' hands."
"Wireless mice are smooth, and for a long time the battery, tiki delivers fast"
"It's beautiful, it's small, it's a little loose, it's relatively satisfying."
"Mouse fits very well, clicks completely without sound. Be pleased"
"The mouse press is quiet, no noise, the end of the scroll button is a pain in the hand, not easy to roll"
"The quality is acceptable, the time of delivery is just the right amount of commitment."
"Small mouse, very handy, sensitive mouse, small click, good"
"It's cheap, so there's not much to expect, it's okay."
To move the mouse.....the smooth surface.....the thick...
Advantage: too cheap: very small
"It's thick, it's easy to move mice, it's pretty fast, and it's packed very carefully."
"Nice mouse pads, anti-slipsy-slip when you're doing this."
"Smooth surface, easy to move mouse"
"It's cheap, it's pretty good."
It's a thick piece of underwear.

Fast delivery of good product
"Apple's own product, originally seal, activates the warranty for one year, doesn't go off-line, wonders between Airpods pro 2 and Airpods 3, eventually selecting Airpods 3 because of their comfort, their self-interest, or their plying on the music mattress, which is comfortable without ear pain."

TERRIA
On the Time of Commitment
"Buying a lot of Apples on tiki, this is the first time I've ever bought a bug product, five days in which I can't charge one of my left ear, and I can't connect with the equipment."
"The machine buys new and delivers 2 hours today October 20th, 2024, but when it's activated, it's limited to August 14, 2025, while Tiki describes the story as 12 months."
"There's an interesting point: buy the 22nd day of the 24th, but activate the warranty from the 12th."
"So when you buy it, you buy it for 13 days, and you fail to charge it, and you can't hear it."
"The delivery is fast, but the sensor error on both sides of your ears does not respond."
I'm asking for innovation.
"Okay, the sound's a little low."
Why can't we connect?
The product doesn't sound as good as expected.
Why did my Airpod buy me an IDEA hidden from another device?
A good hunt for tiki to self-destruct a single client
"Turn your left ear off the power, Tiki reviews the warranty for the product with"
The product doesn't charge the battery.
"Airpods don't connect to computers, although they've tried many ways."
Batteries drop fast.
"The product has a beautiful, thin, neat style... and the mouse is so smooth, and the electricity is pretty smooth... and the electricity is pretty good... because after almost 10 days of use, and it's not out of electricity -- it's like a commercial store, it's probably because your laptop's not connected to the mouse in TPD, but, by the way, it's going to come back."
"Use it well within the price range. Mouse scroll button is a bit slippery, it takes a billion to roll."
"Fast delivery shop, solid package, good quality of product connection ENCOM easily white clean"
"It looks good, it's new, it's very good, it's not clear what it looks like."
The Ship's silent click is tomorrow with a good Sp instead of five stars.
Fine Mouse and Quality
"Super-looking rat, fast-wired bl."
"The delivery is on schedule, the rat has to wait time to see if it lasts."
"It's good, it's good, it's nice, it looks good."
"Nice, smooth mouse."
"The mouse is as big as advertising, the Shop is sending andship is fast, the package is careful, the mouse is beautiful, the piñata"
"I've got a rat line that fits my arm, which is short, and it's worth the price, so that everyone who buys a Shop can give me advice and help me."
"Pleased with sp, and Tiki's support"
"It's a nice mouse, and it's nice and it's nice and it's nice and it's nice and it's nice and it's nice and it's good and it's good and it's good and it's good and it's good and it's good and it's good and it's good and it's good."
"Soft rats, fast, easy-to-use Bluetooth connections, super fast delivery."
"Nice, sensitive, super-speed delivery."
"Look at the perfect pattern of code that goes up and down, and goes up, and goes up, and goes down, and goes down, and goes down, goes down, goes down, goes down, goes down, goes down, goes down, goes down, goes down, goes down, goes down, goes down, goes down, goes down."
"Nice mouse, smooth use, no noise"
Use very much
"The mouse is smooth, stable at the price."
"OK, i'm sorry!"
"Quick delivery of beautiful codes, used on electricity, and if you don't, you'll reevaluate later."
"The package is exactly like the thick cable image. Okay, stop charging fast and transmit data fast."
"China's own goods, made in VN, hope the quality corresponds to the price of the product, and Tiki delivers the goods very quickly."
"I've been buying it for a long time, and it's probably been charging, but the battery's still down."
Max only has 60W while introducing 100W.
We're gonna put this on. We're gonna buy some rope and throw it away.
"It's 100W, but it's not good when it's used for the Mabook Pro."
"I bought it at a time when I had a discount code: 57k - Tiki delivered fast, ordered from May 29 a.m. 2th morning, and delivered it. Tiki always packed the package very well. - Quality: Mouse is very good."
"The Gnatch B1x600dpi buys from the Tiki Trading counter for 50,000 dollars for the cost of the original 90,000. The left mouse press works well. Press the click and don't get sticky. The Digi paste box is the importing unit, the two head of the box which opens the box still has the tape attached to it. The good quality use of the game office works very well. The product has the number S/N in the other package box. Tiki package is well packed (in the carton box box box and on the paper box box is still filled with a paper box), and the delivery worker quickly enough to deliver the product."
"The product has the right quality of the description, the package is solid, it's valuable, it's quick delivery."
"The first time you put the Logotech mouse through Tiki. The slight click feels a little bit light, you roll a little smoother than the new Bolognatech B100 mouse on the company (for after taking a little bit of a spin). I like the mouse clicks a little hard, and I roll it away when I get a good feeling, and the sound feels better at the hearing (for after a little time it will wear out, it will become more lubricated, and it will be smaller and less obvious). Hope will be used shortly (at least 12 months)."
"It's good to get something to try it on, it's smooth, it's a mouse click, it's pretty good to hold it. Because it's a technology, it's good to slow down the quality review, but it's good to look at new things now, and it's good to look at new things."
"Standard line, good price, tiki now delivered fast, five stars."
"Thank the suppliers, the manufacturers, the vendors, thank the salesmen, thank the electronics floor, thank the carriers for this opportunity to use this kind of good product."
"The other night, the next morning the call came in. The nice package the mouse used to have had a mouse in the middle, bought this mouse in the middle of the cauldron."
"The product is like a commercial, a quick delivery."
"Rats are right for their needs, they're perfect for me, they're good for me, I don't have any connection problems, the basic operations are working well at this price range, this is the right mouse."
"We've got the goods, we've got the goods, we've got the goods, we've got the goods, we've got the warm, friendly delivery!"
"You got the product, the real rat and the good price, everybody's safe to buy..."
"Quick delivery, good price."
"I mean, the cost is very soft, and the use of an office computer is great, and I'm good with AI, and it's not too sensitive, but it's still stable."
I don't know if the product is sustainable but it's now used for very good experience.
The right delivery... packed carefully.....tks shop... evaluated five stars...
"Just one word: ""NON BINGHAM"". What are you waiting for, without buying this little mouse back home, right?"" ""The only thing you can say is that the middle mouse isn't sure, but you'll get used to it for a long time."""
It's smooth for office work; it shouldn't be used against games because they're going to be hit with a mouse circuit at a constant click rate.
"Nice, cheap, cheap, very sensitive, and 36-month warranty, too cheap and sustainable."
"The good stuff at the right price, the product is described as good, but when I'm done buying two more accessories and paying with momo's wallet, the delivery form doesn't have the form on it, and the electrical components aren't exactly the same thing as it used to be."
"The mouse's a bit hard, the price is so cheap, the money's all yours, and you'd better buy a fire-proof mouse, and you wouldn't even pick a softer one, and you'd press hard hand pain."
"The delivery: fast, t in Hanoi City, order the last afternoon the shipments. the next afternoon the mouse quality: brand new, fairly sensitive, well-costed, packaged: neat, beautiful, modeled envelopes, hopefully with the quality of Tiki to the consumer."
"The product is described, packed carefully, delivered as expected."
Don't worry about the durability!
We're looking for a mouse that's used for the company's office.
I hope it won't last long.
"Rats are good, tikis are quick to deliver."
"It's so much better than I thought, but it's really worth buying, and I've never bought anything that's gonna evaluate the product, and this is the first thing that I feel like having to evaluate five stars, which is actually better than 57K."
"With the hand, the mouse is light but sensitive, the quality is fine at the price, the price is good, the shop will be supported next time."
"I rolled it so smooth that yesterday's reservation was received. The present is cheap, so it's not too high."
"This rat's better off, so don't worry about changing the batteries."
"The new mouse, the roll is smooth and smooth, the click is like the M100r that you're using, and Tiki delivered very quickly from 1 p.m. and it's almost 2 p.m. because you're using TikiNow, which means you're happy and you're giving it to Tiki."
The order is three days later. Open the box. It's very permissible.

"Main mouse, very reasonable quality, right mouse clicks very smooth, rubber rolls don't hold on sweat, it's very satisfying."

Pack your bags carefully.
"I don't know, but I'm going to judge when it's dirty,Tiki should check this out."
"The good product, worth buying for basic use. The product is that mice have wires that suit them, because they often lose wireless mouse connections, don't need to replace batteries."
"TikiNow's quick delivery, high-special division products, but pretty handsy clicks, not too loud, not too loud, but also Lortatech's product, so it's interesting, and it's also very expensive, and it's consistent with people who have universal needs that don't expect too high."
I don't know how there's 60K but it's so good to use you.
"Organtech's computer mouse is off the table, which is very cheap. OK, for people who seldom use mice like themselves, who buy as much as spoils and don't release money.)"

"By being set before the New Year's, delay delivered so far, the mouse looks like a description. The plug is running. It's worth it, if the rat has to go to the store or whoever has the welding skills can buy themselves online instead as an immortal mouse."
"- The first assessment is a small, flat mouse, long palms, anti-sylled stamp on the mouse - Tiki package good delivery, fast delivery, Sundays, Saturdays that Monday already have."
I'll buy you two to use. Now buy some more. I'll use it very well.
"A lot of customers who want to understand the needs of their clients -- not every customer needs a guide -- a lot of customers who want to figure out for themselves, experience the product, and you shouldn't bother them -- on the other hand, if the customers need help, help them in the best way."
"Light mouse, fair price, small click, consistent with quiet workspace"
"I'm really happy about the product, and the price is cheap, and I'm connected to the good computer, and I'm eating mice."

The mice are a little bit bigger than the cheap wireless mice of logs.

First time I bought this kind of rat and I had nothing to complain about.
"The product is exactly the way it looks, the first step of use feels good! Thank you!"
"Okay, cheap, two years out."
"Short, light, good."
Cheap goods.
"Good product, quick delivery, cheap, polite staff."

Really nice and fast inside!
"I got the goods after two days in Tiki -- fast delivery, carefully packed -- shaped, held-and-hand mouse, plug-in -- the sensitive mouse, the particular thing that I love about this sp is that when I roll in the middle and the click is so smooth, it doesn't sound like Microsoft before, so working late doesn't feel like making noise."
good use
"Fast delivery, good quality of product compared to evil."
Saigon istttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt

Okay.
Good.
"Fast delivery, good use, good money."
It's good.
Good.
"It's very good at super cheap prices, quick delivery."
"Through this little mouse’s positive comment and the appealing cost of her life, she returned home, and for nearly four months she felt that the mouse was very sensitive; the wheel in the middle was easy to use; the long mouse chain was not limited to distance; mouse design, anti-slip, so when her hands were wet, it was easy to use; so I gave five stars in this product."
There's no need to talk about quality.
"High durability mouse, very smooth, sensitive, steady hand press"
"It's cheap, but it's okay, there's a wire out of the battery..."
"It's true that every piece of Logotech that makes you happy, that the mouse buttons are so light and smooth, that skims through the rollbar off the table, the design that's right in the palm of the hand. 10/10."
"I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine."
"It's only 99k, but it's pretty good."
"If this mouse makes a little noise click, it's not a slient."
Good.
"It's very nice and sure, very expensive."
Okay.
"It's good for the price, but I'm not used to it yet."
"Rats are sensitive, they're good, they're good for money, they're good for delivery, they're good for delivery, they're quick, they're packaged, they're good for sure!"

FIGURAL REPUBLICAL REPUBLIC IN THE CENTRAL REPUBLIC
"Quality store, product like description, quality, cheap."
"The product looks like a description, good use, cheapness, okay sensitivity, long rope."
"The sustainable goods are cheap, generally serving the needs of normal people who don't need this kind of weird."
"Good use. It's tough to break. It's okay, it's okay. It's okay. It's okay."
"Buying the satle so cheaply, the mouse handles it, even though it's slightly light, it's soft, it's light, it's gentle, it's quick, it's pretty cool."
"The mouse is so sensitive, the hand is so smooth, and I love it when I'm using it, and I'm buying it during the last commercial campaign, and I'm really happy to have it on my desk, and it's cheap and quality, and it's really good to buy it."
"The mouse uses relative sensitivity, hand-held, solid design; the simple style; the child on the table doesn't need the underwear, and it's very smooth; I've dropped it several times, but she's still running really good; this is the first time I've bought the mouse, and I'm happy about the quality of the mouse compared to the amount of money I've spent."
It's a perfect delivery. <i>Bulls are nice.</i> <i>I'll buy 90K.</i> <i>Now I'll take it to the web.</i> <i>It's a good deal.</i> <i>Taki.</i> <i>It's a bad business.</i> <i>It's a bad business.</i> <i>It's a bad business.</i> <i>It's a good business.</i> <i>It's not a bad business.</i> <i> <i>
"With only 99k, this is a really good mouse, and I've just bought books on tiki, and I've never tried to buy anything else."
Use durability
"I don't know if it's sustainable for a few weeks, but now it's fast and smooth, and it's so low that it will last for three years."
"At this price, it's worth a lot of money, not too small, not too large to be able to work in an office all day long."
"I'm very pleased with the Lorrie mouse product, which is very smooth and sensitive, so when you re-use it, it's not installed, it's generally worth the money."
"Tiki delivers fast. Closes the package carefully. Form the mouse has a good grip, the long use has a slight fatigue. The left mouse key is & light. The roll feels non-smoking, when rotated, when you buy 65K. At this price you don't think you can't ask for a high price. Sp is good for money."
"I bought this mouse when I first bought it because I saw the right price, and after buying it for granted, the mouse was so smooth that it didn't have to be used with a mouse, and the mouse was just going to be able to run, and I found this was worth it."
This product has brands that need to develop more of these products.
"I bought it, and it was pretty sustainable, and it fell a lot, and it was playing video games, and the vp job was OKie."
"Mouse use very smooth, very small and easy to handle. Mouse responds quickly, sensitively."
The brand of the famous Logotech makes mice and keyboards feel better too.
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry, but if you don't want to talk to me, you can't talk to me about it."
I bought another one. It's a good half price.
"It's been months and it's not broken, and it's going to buy the next store."
Two months. I don't know if it's gonna last.
"The best quality, favorite time in tiki, is an extremely fast delivery time."
"I don't know if it's because I don't know how to check, but when I use the Logotech option, it doesn't check. This is a Logotech mouse, because I know that if it's the main product, when it's turned on, it's going to also show that LPTC is connected. It's also very sensitive, though."
"It's good, it's cheap. I use it to do more work at home."
"This rat's good for the office people, and it's good and it's very strong to hold it."
I've been in charge for a week.
"I haven't looked at the quality for a while, but I've just bought a mouse with a new wire for a short time, asking for tiki a few times without seeing a response, a job should have to buy a new one, a rat's voice is lighter than the old one, it's okay."
"Just bought it on Friday, got the package, packed it carefully, but I hope Tiki will let the customers rip it off later. It's better than taking the product out as it's already used."
"Long live, the quality is fine compared to the price of the city, Tiki's package carefully."
"It's been a bit of a while, and I've had to pull back, but I've found it's pretty smooth, so it's good."
Tiki delivers boxes that are distorted despite the warning that they are vulnerable.
"Fast delivery after a day, rats are good, but maybe local tq is different from international goods on the right with logo logs."
"The quick delivery I had at 12:10 a.m. was delivered, and when I received the film was sealed under the mouse's base, it must have been used for a while. I saw a friend who made 2020, but mine was 2019."
"Mouse is good, sensitive and smooth."
I'm very pleased with TiKi's service and TiKi's method of packing and delivery is beautiful and the delivery time is earlier than the order time.
"Rats are cheap, they don't expect more, they work better, but they're a little bit tired because they're really high."
"It's very rare to buy a female seal, it's all out front -- look okay, I don't know if the mouse can last another year."
The delivery box makes you unhappy. <i>The new mouse.</i> <i>Is it possible that the mouse gets watered before that?</i> <i>I hope it's explained.</i> <i>Is it possible that the mouse gets watered?</i>
It's worth money. The delivery is faster than expected. The rat's sensitive.
"The mouse is sensitive to two keys, but the call is quite loud. Especially is the roll between the two clicks at a time the roll is hard, especially when sitting in a space where it needs to be quiet. The Taki delivery service needs to be delivered at the right time, the delivery officer who is friendly with the Tiki package wraps: The electronic device that Tiki packaged is not careful, which doesn't apply to the outside, opens the box where his product is broken, the mouse is knocked out of the box. The box isn't even wrapped in the shock class; this time it's about the way that Tiki package has been packed by Tikii packaged."
"I've been using it for a long time, and I haven't broken or failed at all."
"Buying new used one day failed double click h kb how to trade, trusting tiki checking which is increasingly boring"
"The mouse is good, the mouse rolls are hard, the box is sealed, the overall satisfaction is not to run out to the computer line to find each mouse, which is the Tiki surf two hours later."
"Fast delivery, nice form, but neither of the rats we buy have a warranty stamp, which is not expected at this price, anyway."
"The mouse with the LMtech B100 - carefully packed goods, soft hand operation, soft roll, good quality unknown."
"Left mouse button and a slightly sensitive, soft roll. There is no hardness of new products. New patterns are like ads."
Quick delivery.
"The mouse is a little loud for the hand, and for about 20 to 30 minutes it's going to wear off, and the mouse roll is pretty loud, and it's like pulling the wire, and it's not going to cost much, and Tiki's offering it fast."
"The quality product is very poor. You plug it into the computer, you don't get it, you don't light it."
"Okay, the mouse is soft, sensitive in general. It's easy to use with the people at work."
"I bought a product on July 6, 2020, which is not used, but now that the mouse doesn't work, plugs it into a non-lighted computer, so the product's still being mediated or Shop?"
"Rats aren't so sensitive, they're a little big."
"But for four stars, why don't you put two products together and deliver them into two days at the same time?"
"The mouse can be used, the mouse can fit quite nicely, but the mouse feels a bit loose, and between the slots there's quite dusty."
"The delivery guy's in bad shape, no client feedback, Tiki's getting worse."
good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good
"The mouse is smooth, but I've been using it for a month. It's not going to work, it's not going to work, it's not going to work, it's not going to work, it's not going to work, it's not going to work."
Do you think that's more of a LOCTECHMy?
"The price's good, but the use of more is already paralyzed."
It's not sensitive.
"Fast delivery, temporary quality at this price, you're nearly going to fail in the next two days because when it feels like it's going to fall out, you can't even ask for better things."
"Fast delivery, mice that are medium sized, mice that aren't sensitive, and the sticky underwear that needs to improve, and this low-level product is quite reasonable for students, students."
Fined model to use every day;)
Rats don't have special buttons.
"It's not working, it's just because it's cheap, but next time, it's not buying that cheap stuff."
"Press button when the feeling is a little hard, not very sensitive, the mouse tear is a bit slow."
"You know, if you're in a few offices, you're going to have to eat when you're not going to eat."
The product often loses connection to the machine
It's basically temporary.
"Compared to this price, the mouse uses pretty well, well-packed, long-term unknown, but it's available right now."
"In any case, it's like being fucked, both of them."
Good.
"The rats are moving well, should be buying"
"Tiki's package was very careful, and my old band was tied so I went back and bought this one with a rope, and I was scared to get it, but it was lined up, and it was fixed because of a string, so I just took a little bit of it, and I had my hands on it."
"Unsensitivity, poor connection, hand tired movement, noise click"
"K has any information on where to sell, warranty, warranty."
"Rats are sensitive. play a good game. since logs are already available, trust is given."
"We haven't been home yet, so we don't know what sp is yet."
"I'm using this mouse because I believe in the Arkentech brand, which I use for my computer."
Okay.
"If I don't buy it for 30 days, I can't connect, I can preserve it, and I can preserve it."
"You've received a package like a picture, a quick delivery, a carefully packed package, a quality that fits the price, a mouse that doesn't go very well."
"This is too slow delivery. Every day, every day, every day, every day, every day. But I'm waiting three days to get a late notice."
"Sensitivity, good use."
"The product is fine, but the app is constantly showing popup. Requesting ratings to disturb the user."
That's a bad idea to buy.
"It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay?"
"Quality is OK, drop is a week behind delivery, hope Tiki doesn't lose customers because of transportation (."
Quality oke. Secured and delivered tikinow very quickly. Good quality at the expense.
It's only been two months later.
I hope it's cheaper this time than it'll last longer:
Rats don't work for a few days.
"A normal mouse, not a cat."
"It's a super tough mouse, but I feel a long rope, except for the inconvenience, and everything's fine at this price."
"Looks like, work fine. Close your bags carefully."
Good price.
"It's cheap, Tiki delivers it quickly, it's packed carefully, I'd like to say it's the second one, and if it's strong, it'll buy more."
"Rats attached, but no lights, no tiki help."
The right mouse key has an impossible sensor error.
"The seal is secure, but you've got a bad pulse, or something, rolling a boring page."
"Okay, but it's only been over a month."
"Cheap rat, okay."
Use it at a price range.
"Get the fuck out of the shop, please."
"It's good, it doesn't feel so good. It's not much better than shooting an N100."
Pretty good.
"So, this is a pretty sensitive SIGIGGGGGGGGGGGGG, which is consistent with you working on Fresnod,excel, or on the Internet, but playing hard games has to do with a mouse, which is pretty good, which is cool, which is good for my laptop, so I'm very good for it."
Pretty good.
Pretty good.
enabled
"Quality: light mouse, very touchy mouse, but sometimes slightly twitchy. The price: fit the money, fit the students.<br />The package pack: tiki makes very carefully, the classes with the shock bag, I'm very weak, I'm quite pleased with the production."
"Rats use stable, yet long-held sensations suffer from slight weight"
THE 2 WEEKS ARE DIFFERENT LIKE THE DIFFERENT.
"The mouse floats like a cloud, hits it, moves like this, and the mouse runs away."
"Oke, friendly shiper"
"I didn't use a mouse on my computer before, and when I had to do a lot of things, I decided to go to tiki and find a mouse:D, and I'm using this light mouse, and I feel comfortable holding the palm of my hand, which is pretty smooth, but I still like this one a little bit smaller."
"Fast delivery, good at the price, you're holding two buttons on the roll with a slight chilling noise... but the mouse is sensitive."
Okay.
"The mouse is sure to pack, using smooth use but the mouse part is rolling to make a loud noise."
Unsharp quality. Mouse click button harder than last wave
"It's better than the price of money, it doesn't work when the mouse moves on the surface of the glass."
"The main brand of logologs should not worry about quality, high delivery."
"The product is delivered very quickly; the mouse is also very good, smooth and comfortable when it's used; the point that it's currently not moving is that it's not moving at all on slippery surfaces, and the rest is pretty good!"
correct description
The mouse uses well but the package is somewhat simple and bad for tiki but offers no request for writing content in 50 characters
"Old sp, no warranty stamp."
It's good. It's good. It's good.
Good.
"The mouse clicks quite well, but the roll still finds a lot of controvert and unpleasantness."
"I don't know how to spend it very long, but it's sad you can't do it yourself."
"Mouse is well used, but long used has also failed to stick to left mouse"
The mouse on the left is very difficult. It's almost impossible.
You can't use it for two days.
"I've tried the mouse with a lot of computers, but it doesn't work. It's boring."
"Pack it carefully, deliver it quickly, and use it to figure out what's good."
"The roll mouse doesn't seem so sure, to try and use it."
"Rows, like descriptions, haven't been used yet, so the details haven't been evaluated yet."
The soldiers don't want him.
Henagd spear fast socks good
"The good product, the quick delivery, is compared to what Tiki announced in order."
It's hard to use the easy-to-use hard-core roll. How am I going to switch?
The mouse with the bt office was ok the shipment came back and found the mouse box being torn apart and the mouse didn't come out at all 3 *
"The delivery is extremely fast, the package is carefully packed, the right button is worth the price."
"The mouse is okay, the middle mouse is not smooth, it sounds too loud, it doesn't look good."
"I ordered the next morning the delivery was delivered, and the pawns were quite fond of them, but I'm sorry the scroll bar wasn't light, and the sound was coming out, but they still liked it."
"We're using it normally right now, and at this price, it's too good, I hope it's going to last a long time."
"Rat's on it. Okay, I feel fine."
"I roll in the middle of a mouse. It's not very smooth, it's not very good, it's not good."
Four stars.
It's not moving very well.
"Next time, I'll stop by the shop and pick it up."
"Use it well, be patient, be stable, but deliver it for more than a week -- yet deliver the wrong address!"
"Rats are a bit loud. Rats are a little short-handed. I don't know, 'cause they're not used to it."
& Use temporary
"It's cheap, but it's very expensive, and brands are famous, although they're made in China, the quality is pretty much relative to the price, which is very small, very well matched for average and small hands, and for big people it's not too small."
"Rats work well, quick delivery, even though they're oem, they're pretty good."
"The product that combines student money, the delivery sooner than expected, the product that's used quite well, is very pleased!"
"You're going up and down a little louder, and you're complaining about it."
"The delivery was slow, ordered from Thursday but t2 weeks later due to sp's non- Tikinow."
"Tikinow delivers less than half a day, and the quality of the product is good."
"You buy two for more than two months, one's broken, one's gone."
"The good product, I'm satisfied with your service quality"
"The product's relatively good with this price, so to speak, should be bought."
It's not working. It's not lighting.
Tiki needs a faster delivery. I think the slowest three days is okay.
"Everything's okay compared to the price, I'm going to roll pretty loud."
Okay.
"It's hard to move, it's hard to move, it's hard to move, it's hard to move, it's safe to pack, it's quick to deliver, it's quick to look... it's okay, it's perfectly safe to pack."
"Tiki delivers more than 24 hours, mice have to use a slightly stronger press force than any other mouse, a roll that doesn't like hands, so that's fine. Anyone who wants a good experience and a good one shouldn't buy one."
"There's no mouse speed adjust button, no long-sharp sensitivity."
"We can use it, we can't make it."
"The mouse's a little light on the handle, but it's fine, it's good for the price."
"Rats are too cheap (when you buy only 99k), down 10 percent of your visa and 89k), and find that review is good enough to buy. Mouse is very light and comfortable, and this design is certainly not going to be painted like your old mouse, and it's not going to be sweaty because it's sweating, but it's not going to feel like it's not going to be smooth, but it's also going to be okay."
HOW IS THE DIFFERENT DIFFERENT DIFFERENT 15 DAYS TO BE DIFFERENT?
"Rats are fine, but a few days later, there's signs of movement."
"I like this mouse because it's cheap for students, but it's very good."
"Quick pick-up, happy staff, pretty good quality so."
Use ok
quick delivery
"Rats are fine, and at that price, rats are fine."
"It's not accurate to buy it, but it's not much to ask for at that rate."
I bought more after I tried one.
"Because I'm a Gintech computer mouse, I'm also relieved to order it, but I've got about a week, the mouse is broken, the left key can't be pressed, whereas the right key and the top button is still normal:((((((()))"
"It's big, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good."
It's the real product.
"The delivery is on schedule, and to the present, the product is still good, and this unit seems to be doing a prestigious job."
The product's fine compared to the price.
Okay.
Okay.
Good at the price.
"I love the way that Tiki got me the package, the product I bought, and the plastic bag, and the outside dam, and the warranty stamp, and the Tagotech mouse, and it's okay, and it's light, and it's black and it's nice, and in a few days, the rat will come to Tiki and buy it."
Pleased with the quality and price of this product
"There's a balance of Nintendo B100, a good view, good quality, which is that if you're looking for a string, then this is a matter of choice."
"The Logotech is quite sensitive to a laptop connection, but after a short while, the power lines will be exposed, although the mouse will still be available, but there will be some uncertainty:"
"It's not very smooth, or double-clicked."
"It's always stable, it's safe to use."
"Thank you, shop."
"Left mouse + right use good, soft touch and light but the mouse roll is too sensitive to feel"
The package is a bit slow. The delivery will support tiki.
Rats don't go very well. It's been a long time.
Okay.
"Rats are good for computers, light and price is pretty good."
"The quality of the package is fine, the delivery is on schedule."
"Quick delivery rate, reasonable price for quality."
"Okay, quick push isn't very sensitive"
The product is like a description. The mouse uses it well.
log row 0-2 is both good and good for money
"It's good use, it's good use, it's good for good, it's good for good, it's good for good."
"Standard goods, goods, goods, goods, goods, goods, goods."
"The mouse's a bit slow and hard to use. It's not as smooth as it's supposed to be, it's not as soft as it's supposed to be."
Sensitive mice are good. Please
What's your money?
"It's good, but it's not long since you've had doubleclick -- it's very uncomfortable."

"Tiki needs to correct the return process immediately. I have the wrong product so I've created the y/restore, in order to specify the reason, to make sure that the package has been removed. However, when the delivery unit is ready to pick it up and check it, bring it out about three hours later, someone calls it in, says that the staff at Tiki's office announced that the application is not ready to pay for the package."
"Just got the package open check emei and used the day, quick charge and quality charge, thanks Tiki"
Okay.
The cost of cutting off the feeling of the wire on your arm is very thick and sure:

"New purchase, quick charge, stronger wire than the old wire."
"I'm using an aker powerline i and i put it in an amz jp, and I see that the cable of the TMT is different from the Japanese cable. First of all, it's a sprained box, complete cable has extra plastic. Second, there's a cable on the cable, but not found on the cable."
"Main store, ok compatible for iTunes."
Good.
"I don't know how long it's been used, but it's okay to charge it. It's a price!"
"Good quality cable, but it doesn't feel as good as an iPhone cable."
"The wire is solid, the design is beautiful, the charge is fast and stable, the price is a little high."
"I have ordered, morning received, product as description. 5 stars for service"
"Cap is very fast in the day, the company itself is well-funded."
"The delivery is extremely fast, the product is exactly the same as we are on Tiki Trusts."
"The product is good, precise and detailed, high certainty."
"It looks harder, it's bigger than a zin, it's a better length, it's shorter than zin, but it's very convenient."
"Standard Anker, expensive but well spent. How about a 50-star limit?"
"The charge is fast, sure, but it's a little short, but it's a little long:"

"The product looks nice and solid, the company can check on the system."

"This cable has an MFi no qtv certificate, which wants to buy de charge ip 7plus"
"The wire, the red on the surface, is worth the money."
"The wire is solid, tiki delivers on time. Okay."
"It's a pleasure, it's a cuckold, it's a cuckold, it's a cuckold!"
"The wire is solid, the charge is fast and steady, and it's worth money."
"It's a good product, sure, but it's a little short."
"Just got the goods, the brand new tape cover, the whole set, opening up the box, the stuff inside's in the box, not the business, not the business, not the use yet, but it feels like it's not feeling good, asking for tiki to keep a close eye on the sale!"
"I bought this one (white) and got it every day November 13th, 2018, and in the first six months the charge was steady, fast, the wire wasn't hot."
It's not as good as it looks compared to the Anker wire we bought directly from Japan.
"Fast delivery, outside envelopes, stamps and duct tape, but when open, the plastic bag inside is cut off in a very clear corner like this, feeling suspicious of its origin."
The company service is like shit. Ah seal delivered to the client in pieces. And now it says there's no evidence that it's dead.
"For Tiki it's okay, it's just an Anker's charge cable."
"Just bought, 10 times his body is damaged, no more use."
"I can use it for over a year and I can see that it's starting to break up like in the picture, and I usually wrap it in a box carefully, and I don't know why it's happening."
Tiki asked me why is it that when check-checking seturity code at anker.com/verify comes to notice that maybe it's fake?
They're buying ropes for use. <i>Who's a little bit of good for a living.</i> <i>There's five broken days.</i> <i>Can't change?</i> <i>What's wrong with you?</i> <i>What's wrong with you?</i> <i>What's wrong with you?</i> <i>What's wrong with you?</i> <i>What's wrong with you?</i> <i>What's wrong with you doing?</i>
"Be careful with the package, the package is correct, but there's a real check code that stamps the star number:"
"Let me ask you how I still have my warranty stamp, and how I pay for it, and my cable goes off at a little bit, and I don't charge it, and I see my warranty for 18 months, and I still have my history to buy, and I don't know how to pay for it."
"Quick delivery, but the stamp is not intact"
I don't know if they're even.
"The poor product, I forbid more than 10 times to charge than I do, is to start a short wave, ask the shop to contact me in exchange for the product."
"I bought two wires, one blue one black one, and the blue one had this phenomenon, and the black one didn't, and I bought a blue one, and I bought a blue one like this one and I had the same phenomenon."
"In harmony with iphone, I've just used, I'll review later"
You can't use it. You're dead.
"If we don't use it, we'll lose the R-string, we'll charge it."
Sometimes the machine doesn't get charge when it plugs directly into the power drive:
"+ Main Line, checkable on antler.com/ Large charge cable and feel surer than machine cable. What's important is that the MFI certificate by Apple should use comfort. Unfortunately, the short cable (0.9m), but the 1m8 is too long for you. From your personal point of view, the cable should do enough. (3m.3m.3ft)."
Thanks for checking on this order. Thanks.
"I bought the wrong cable, it's not compatible with the charge, it's supposed to be the type C cable."
"One week's use is bad, you can't get in, you shouldn't buy it."
"Normally, the price is high for the same kind, which is the same quality and pattern."
"Hi Tiki, I just bought it a few months ago, and right now, the charge lines are wired, stuck to a confirmed phone -- I don't accept it constantly, I want to preserve it."
"The Shop see if I've got 10 days to get paid through momo, and I'm still not getting it yet, and all the other carbs I've bought for two, two, three days have been paid, so you don't send them?"
"It's been a long time since it's been hot, it's like him, it should be considered when it's bought."
"The delivery is too slow, the delivery is comfortable after the exchange, but it's not delivered, waiting for the buyer to file a new return complaint."
"You buy three days of charge, you get this kind of blackness, both sides of it, and then you don't charge the power."
The charge cable is in a tiny plastic bag and put it in a box. <i>I don't know if it's the main product.</i> <i>Tiki is the main one.</i> <i>Ship is pretty fast.</i>
"You just bought it, you burned the copper wire, you can't use it, you can't hit the battery, 0 for quality."
"My cable for nearly eight months is still broken, my head is broken, my head is broken, my break-up technology is inaccurate, my conclusion to buy tens of thousands of dollars will be able to spend the same amount of time and then change the other wire, less money."
"Anker's cable is pretty good, but white is pretty easy, and you notice, you can wrap the cable around it, or you can pick the fabric cover line, and I think it's not very comfortable, but the quality is quite reassuring."
We can't get it back. We can't get it back by week's charge.
I don't know if it's the main product.
"This cable doesn't work for iphone 5 seconds with 1A charge (A main battery and Anker cock are not available). The product has to be used for.4A. When received by iphone 5 seconds, it's good for iphone 6,6s."
"It's just delivered in the afternoon, it's unchecked, it's open, it's cut in the mouth, it's torn like this!"
"I've got three weeks worth of pre-loading, one day I'll be back in the morning and I won't get on the battery."
The wire looks like it's packed well.
"It's only been four months, but now we can't charge it, we can't charge it, we can't charge it."
"I can buy one year, I can't charge it, and the product's been preserved for 18 months, and now I don't know how to issue it."
It's not working for a month.
"I've only been able to use it for a few months, and I'm not going to make it."
"The charge's okay, but to transmit the data, it's not like a real iphone charge?"
"It's good, it's good."
"No delivery, contact the operator number no one picked up, text on the app, no return check."
"The loose wire, the ten-tenths, even the charging wire, is too disappointed with the dealer's sp and the product of tiki."
Provider: Tiki Trading NK & PP: CtyTL Technology Checks really well.
Is my wire broken after a couple of weeks of use ever gonna get a warranty?
"Quick delivery. The box has standard check code but has cut stamps in the front cover of the previous box. This is used from time to time, by plugging in the computer connection to ""open the iphone for use of USB accessories"" (this will learn more)"
"Three hundred and tens of thousands of dollars and markets, too disappointed by this product."
The cable cable plugs into the charged phone that's on/off constantly doesn't eat electricity.
"Take care of the package, just like the samples."
"Fast delivery, good looks quality."
"5 days later, we'll be in and out of here."
This cable combines with Anker Sac's IQ 12W charge not much faster than a cable charge.
"The solid charge line, which is the big size, doesn't look neat, and I think I should buy it if it's a sustainable priority."
"At first, we saw the tiny little box again, we had to put our socks together, but we had to check again, and it was fine, and the wire was pretty hard and the charge was pretty good."
"For more than a year, the charge is starting to get a little bit unplugged."
"The wire delivered on March 13, so far, it's been two months since it's been charged, the quality's too bad."
It's been a week since I bought it.
Not as much as I'd like.
Sp from November 20th 1717 to now charge off the battery.
Fine.
The product is exactly the same as the fast - delivered tiki
It's all right.
"Package well, delivered at the right time"
It's time to evaluate.
I've been buying since June for four months and now I'm broke.
"The wire's good! The wire's quick! I don't know how long I've been using lighting power currents and carbles for 18 months, and I don't know how long it's gonna last until the 19th."
"It's been a couple of days since the package's been packed for too long, I hope it's worn out, for two stars, because we haven't received the package."
Okay.
Buying about is not working.
I need a warrant.
Okay.
It's easy to break your head.
Okay.
Okay.
"Long live, well worked, worth the price."
"The pick-up is faster than expected, check the company's main code, using it with an enreergizer charge."
"Fast delivery, it's the same company."
Good quality product
"Hansel, charge fast, but white fast."
Okay.
The main charge doesn't look good.
"It's a bit expensive, I hope there's more marketing to get us a good price."
"Fast delivery of goods. Quality products, should add other colors to the selection."
"Pleased with the product, quick charge"
"The firm's main product anker, sure and used very well, but it's a little short."
The product is like a quick delivery.
Use ok and buy two. It's sad to buy the black line without a discount at 330.
It's harder to hold it than it's got a rope.
"Fast charging cable, looking at the wire pretty solid, seems to be sustainable over time:)"
The charge is loose compared to the ankers we bought at another store. It's pretty disappointing.
"It's a beautiful product, to spend some time watching, not satisfied with the delivery that's a few days behind."
The quality's fine.
"tiki delivers too slowly, puts in lots of forms, but all forms are slow."
"Why is it that when I check the barcode of this product, I report errors?"
"We can use the data to convert the charge speed, then bt."
"It's really tough, but it's fast."
"Fast charge, good price. That's a lot of money."
Good materials keep charging fast.
Perjection
Good.
"I'll buy it once, I'll sell it, I'll sell it, I'll sell it, I'll sell it, I'll sell it, I'll sell it, I'll sell it, I'll sell it, I'll sell it, I'll sell it, I'll sell it, I'll sell it, I'll sell it, I'll sell it!"
"One week at a time, there's no time for it."
"You can buy it for one day, then you can charge it the next day."
"Fast delivery, carefully wrapped, but the cable's a little big, and each charge has to be unplugged."
It's a dead end. We can't afford it. It's been a month.
"Handing over a cave, giving up orchids, across the way, Tiki nenn sees the future of chats that cause us to die."
"Let's do it quickly. OK, let's do it again. OK, let's do it again."
Good.
"The quality is great, but it's pretty heavy."
"The sound ears are stable, and the blue ones are nice, everybody, and they're going to continue to support it, and thanks to the shop, Tiki delivers super fast."
"The package was careful, caring, good, I used this product and decided to order it again."
"The wire earpiece is a little bit weirder than the traditional wire, but I prefer it a lot more because it's hard to break + it's definitely a nice color. The package product is carefully packed and the quality of sound is fine within the price range."
"The sound ear is fine at the price, the talking mic's pretty good, I use music and online meetings, no matter the quality of sound not too good, the beautiful pastel color, the ear plug like the earphone before."
"I'm listening, even though I haven't used up all my hii, deliver it carefully, quickly and safely, even with a kind of hard-eared hearing without the softness of the ear, like the other kind of earpiece."
"Nice package has an earphone box, sound or deep bass. So OK, moss likes cool tiki now very fast communication"
The blue is very nice. The wire is solid. It doesn't care if it's broken. It's good for me!!
"Conspiracy, sound quality ok, not very good for price, but okay, let's hope it's sustainable."
"Sound sounds good, delivered fast, looks good, each with a slight bump in the head due to a fixed wire."
"The sound sounds good, the mic sounds clear, the pattern's beautiful, and this is, compared to the price, the product's worth taking care of. P.S.: the image's not very visual."
"Beautiful, sure, sound clear at the price, satisfied!"
"Nice hearing, super-beautiful patsy, smooth sound, no earaches, the best fight, the hope of enduring."
"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
"It's so good, it's blue, it's so tight, it's so strong, it's so beautiful, it's so strong, it's so beautiful, it's so strong, it's so beautiful, it's so beautiful, it's so beautiful."
"The loud sound, the speaker's edge is a little sharp, I'm good at the price!"
"Let's take some headsets, ears ache if we're carrying a lot of these things, but we're very, very, very, very, very, very easy to use."
"Good sound, no earaches, big-ass boxes, heavy hands, to preserve the earpiece, which is pretty convenient."
"In the early spring, the product is too fast, sounds or quality."
"Well, the wire or the wire is out of the shield, so take good care of it or it'll break."
"Good sound, no ear pain, young design and sureness"
"Thanks to Tiki's shipper, the delivery was fast, and before today, it's urgent. Thank you. Thank you."
"Good earpiece, suitable price, puppet wire, fashion, fast delivery for five stars."
"Thank you, shop."
"I've tried the hardness of the rope when my cats bite. I'm pretty sure the part in my ear doesn't have a cushion, so the plastic is hard to hear if you're not careful."
"Good sound, super solid wire, satisfied with product."
"I've bought this ear many times, all very well, the Shop prepares quickly, I'm very pleased, I'll continue to support it!"
"The sound's fine compared to the price, it's not as good as the old xyomi's, but it's fireproof, so it doesn't really matter."
Good sound sounds very sweet.
"It's kind of hard to clean up if you're stuck with a rope, you don't even know how to use it."
"Quick delivery, proper cargo, quality unknown, nice headset."
"Fast delivery, right color, sample. Sound's fine, let's see how long it lasts."
"It's a nice box, it's a hard-on, it's all ears, it's a piece of music. It's better than earpieces, it's an HSA phone box."
"I just want to say, ""It's worth a bowl of rice from the package box to the quality of the wire"" and the bass sound, it's great!"
"I look at the newly ordered responses, the package is pretty simple, but sure, the headset's pretty good, it's not corny, it's one-and-a-half-foot wire, sure, the speakers are pretty tight, you should buy them."
"Good sound, beautiful color, I appreciate this product. Thank you, tiki."
"M just ordered, tiki's 2-hour delivery support, I hope the headset's good."
It sounds good. It looks good.
"I think the delivery's pretty fast, the package's good, the sound's good."
"The wire is solid, and it's okay, but it's not messed up, so I'll buy it."
"I bought my headsets and came up with a week's fault, and the store and the store gave me a new one."
I'm very pleased with the sound of stability.
"Good sound, quick delivery, favorable color."
"The warm ear and the price, the beautiful form within 200K."
The product after four months has no sign of a rope wear or break.
"Sounds good, hands-on, worth the price."
"The earpiece fits the price, the game's good, the canvas's wrapped, so the moès don't bite."
"Beautiful earpiece, well-groomed straps, smooth ears, nice, vivid sounds."
"There's a lot of good stuff for you, boss."
"Sounds good, but the price's a bit chatty!!!"
"Good quality sound, nice, solid box."
"Sp is good, it sounds good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good sound, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good sound, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good,"

Okay.
Use it fine.
sp ok
"The quality of sound is acceptable compared to the price, but there's a point except that the fabrics are not stretched straight, and after a short time of use, the plastics inside will be out of shape."
"I'm kind of excited about the sound, the one side, the one side, the one side, the one side, the one side, the one side, the one side -- the one side -- the one side -- the one side -- the one side -- the one side -- the one side -- the one side -- the one side -- the one side -- the one side -- the one side -- the one side -- the one side -- the one side -- the one side -- the one side -- the one side -- the one side -- the other side -- the other side -- the other side -- the other side -- the other side -- the other side -- the other side -- the other side -- the other side -- the other side -- the other side -- the other side -- the other side -- the other side -- the other side -- the other side -- the other side -- the other side -- the other side -- the other side -- the other side -- the other side -- the other side -- the other side -- the other side -- the other side -- the other side -- the other side -- the other side -- the other side -- the other side -- the other side -- the other side -- the other side -- the other side -- the other side -- the other side -- the other side -- the other side -- the side -- the side -- the other side -- the other side -- the other side -- the other side -- the one side -- the side -- the side -- the side -- the side -- the side -- the one side -- the side -- the side -- the side -- the side -- the side -- the side -- the side -- the side -- the side -- the side -- the side -- the side -- the side -- the side -- the side -- the side -- the side -- the side -- the side -- the side -- the side -- the side -- the side -- the side -- the side -- the side -- the side -- the side -- the side -- the side -- the side -- the side -- is the side -- the side -- the side -- the side -- the side -- the side."
"Listen to the sound, okay, until... I go to work and I put my headphones in my backpack, I just take my hand on the plane, I get a broken one side, I have to get a little sticker, I'm going to take a ride out of here, I'm going to leave my ear open, I'm going to leave it behind."
"I don’t know what to do later, but except for the late shippership point, I got the call, “The client I'm supposed to deliver another day, and then I'm going to take another one, and then I don't want toy:"
"I put it in pink and I deliver it in blue, and in terms of quality, it's certainly hard to break, and the sound of the bass sound is good."
"Tiki delivers it fast, sounds fine compared to the price, the construction fabrics, I use about two days of torn cloth, I can't fit the wire in, I'm pretty good compared to the price."
"The better the earpiece gets out of the coating, the more the use comes out, the more likely it is to break."
"At this price range it sounds pretty good, envelope sure, but soundproofing's not very good."
"It's not a good design, it's a big earpiece, it's a long, tickled ear, the fabric outside the wire doesn't fit long enough, and it's loose, and it's loose, and it's loose, and it's very loose, and it's very loose, and it's very loose."
"The sound's fine, but the little wire on the earpiece is pretty thin, and it's taken a while for it to be peeled, and the wire's loose."
"It sounded a little ache at first, but it's getting used to it. Okay, it's a sound sound that's okay, compared to price, color is my favorite color."
Give me the product. I heard there's one left. I'm supposed to check it out first.
"Listen to good music, but the way the package is making the end of the rope break out"
"Wire is shorter than expected, the outside shield is a little tight, so the wire is not soft."
"The wire seems solid, the sound's stable at the price."
"The product's boring, the earpiece's in a hurry to get out of the plastic."
"The broken wire can't reach straight, hard and uncomfortable to wear, and the ear is not sure."
"The quality of hearing is good, I bought it for a second time, but my earpiece failed to see the aesthetics."
"Sounds good for the money, the wire's tight and it's easy to hear, and it's curly."
It's not as expected. It's already wired.
The sound quality is good but the wire from the split place is twisted
"I bought it in the first place pretty good, but it's only been two days. Is it like this? Is it tight outside or something?"
"The thick end of the rope is thin and thin, and it's bought because it looks like it's going to last for almost a month, and it's not going to die."
Just bought a few days ago.
"It's not very good to coordinate. It's okay, it's okay, it's fine, it's fine, it's fine, it's fine, it's fine, it's fine, it's fine, it's fine, it's fine, it's fine, it's fine, it's fine, it's fine, it's fine, it's fine, it's fine, it's fine, it's fine, it's fine, it's fine, it's fine, it's fine."
"You can't hear anything, you can't even try it, you can't even try it, you can't even try it, it's a waste of money."
"The hearing ear after a year is deaf on both sides, the top wire is very poor."
"The product is quite good, the rope is sure, theship is fast, but the little ear should not buy, wear quite an earache, no button to increase volume"
Roger that.
"It's not very good hearing, even if it's down."
"You know, for a few days, it's like the wire's about to break."
"Well, here's the price."
"It's okay, but one of your earpieces is short, and it looks like the wire's broken, and it needs to be responded from the shop."
"Too bad for a while, you know."
"The headset doesn't have a sound adjustment function, a solid design wire, a hard break, a good use."
Headsets are definitely not that big of a sin.
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.
"The earpiece is hard and very painful, no contral volum node."
"The wire is wrong, the first time is like the last time."
It's kind of a pain in the ear.
"Use it well, within range, buy your nephew online."
"She missed her delivery one day, and all of a sudden, all of a sudden, all of a sudden, all of a sudden, all of a sudden, all of a sudden, all of a sudden, all of a sudden, all of a sudden, all of a sudden, all of a sudden, all of a sudden, all of a sudden, it's 100 percent."
It's a nice blue.
Standby.
"The tight, beautiful wire to regret the quality of sound compared to the welld."
Pretty cool.
"The earpiece's a little loose, it's okay."
"It's beautiful, but it's better if the bass is improved."
It's a pretty good ear.
"It won't last, Mike."
Events
Sp. Sounds good.
"The ear wire is thin, it doesn't sound good, it's boom, it's boring."
"It's nice, it looks solid, it's just a little short."
Listen to the good wire. Listen to the music.
It doesn't sound like a thin wire.
It's very painful to wear.
It's not okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.
Okay.
It's okay. It's good to use.
Nice.
It's a day-long delivery.
"All right, let's pack up."
Sounds good.
Earache.
It's pretty good to use.

That sounds really good.
Good.

Okay.

"Well, the rating doesn't count for a good quality, compared to the price."
"It's extremely satisfying to have the product that's exactly the same as the description, the package is solid, it's very expensive, it's fast delivery."
"Beautiful goods, quality sounds OK, quick delivery, satisfied!"
"Nice earphone, sounds that can be used for ipad pro port type c like shop"
It's been a bit of a pain in the ear for a while.

"The sound is expensive, it's sustainable."
Quick delivery. Good quality.
"Just now, I can hear an ear."
"His ears are cheap, he doesn't ask for anything more."
"I was going to put it in Cellphone, but because I was on HDBC, I was going to go down by tiki Trust, so Tiki didn't read the comment."
"This time it's good enough to buy tiki's electronics so this time the high price is the OTP code before receiving the goods. Enable the warrant: tiki sends the bill, downloads the dpkg file, calls at 18 o'clock (9 to 18 p.m.), Monday, Friday, listen to instructions."
"The brand-new, sophisticated, non-verbal check-ups on the web, check-ups on the web exactly the ones that don't exist. TikiNow delivers on time, sets at 23:45 14/03 and picks up the next morning. The product works well, the functions are fine, the sound quality is fine, the sound quality is not good."
"I'm very upset about buying the goods, and I've opened up what I heard inside, and it's as annoying as something that's fallen off! I'm calling to preserve it, and I'm sending it back two months later, and I understand what kind of business it is!"
"It's been a week since I've had a really good week, and it's a very reasonable price for a buffalo battery, so I'm putting in an operation, so it's a month away, but it's okay to see the quality."
"Tiki makes a thorough contribution, the livepod box, the product works very well, very well."
"The first time I bought high value on the Internet, I'm sure I'd like to set up the night of the 9 that noon 11 has been in theship, so call tiki said to activate the warrants and call Apple's cskh."
"The delivery is expected, packaged carefully, intact when received, about the product that was given the correct sample, the Vietnamese code, which has not been used very long, has not been very much evaluated for the quality of the product."
"I ordered airpods 2, new goods, no signs opened, but my left ear couldn't hear them. I don't know if there's a problem later."
"Thank you, tiki."
"I've taken care of it, so I'm going to fix the evaluation. People are having problems with feedback and waiting for tiki to take care of it."
"Sets it at sunset in SG, 1745, set it to 1835."
"Ship is fast, well wrapped, battery earphones OKe, standard, heavy suction cap, but I don't know yet how to activate the warranty warranty."
Let's see how the warranty works.
"The only question is why there's no serial number on tiki's bill is that there's also a friend who buys vn/a code in tiki, but on the bill there's no serial number, so I'm a little scared to hear from tiki."
"The new product, which is proud of this is AirPoints, produced in Vietnam. -Tiki mountainship very fast at 9:21 p.m. 11 p.m. - The package inside and outside needs to remain intact - the high-value goods only trust Tiki - I don't know how to activate electronic traffic."
"It's okay, the service is good. When you get sp failed, tiki is very eager to support the new sp."
"The quality of good product, which has been used for over a dozen days, is not a mistake."
The price on tiki is so much cheaper than any other tmdt floor.
"It's because of the possession of import and main goods, but after reading people's evaluations on both sides, it's decided to pick the Main Bank, because it's a little bit more secure with VN/A code and corporate maintenance, but it's better off with the prices on Tiki than the people who distribute other major goods and get paid by credit cards."
The delivery was expected as far as a week ago.
The ear sounds good. It's great. It's great. It's great. It's great.
"Since Kiyoko's new policy of not allowing themselves to be activated on the web, I went to 18x0 operators to activate and had to wait 20 minutes to meet the consultant."
"Main product, raw product, product delivered to hands in good condition - intact, unmoved."
"Well, there's a store that's on top of Airpods 2 but it's got Airpods 1, but the price's still OK for the market, so okay."
"Fast delivery, nice earpieces, very smooth, very clear, down to 3159, and then kaka as well."
"The hearing is fine, the serial numbers aren't activated, and I'm calling up the radio operators because they're activated. OK, however, the date of the purchase is the bill of tiki and the system of amphoras is off, so in two days, Bonus is super fast delivery, I've got it at 12:30 p.m. I've got it in hand."
"The delivery is faster than expected, but hopefully there's a note or a shipper calling first, not a shipper, and then it's called. If it's not in the receiving place, then how is it?"
The product's okay. There's something that's been going on for two months.
"It's good to see the good stuff, but I've got the credit card, so why don't I see a change of profile, and if any of you have bought it, let me ask you how long it's been changed."
"Quick delivery, 10:00 a.m., 2:00 p.m.'s already up."
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.
That's great. That's great. That's the ear.
"Hmm. First time mk buys ntn-style tech on tiki nma that's more than you can imagine, the whole set, check code, the firm, the sound is good, tikiship is fast."
"Quick delivery, check out the company's main product, my self-sustaining consultant updates were also very enthusiastic, every one of them very, very bad.) (Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter)"
"It's the main product, the whole set of goods, delivered quickly before expected time."
"I've got it, I've got it, I've got it, I've got it, I've got it, I've got it, I've got it, I've got it, I've got it, I've got it, I've got it, I've got it, I've got it, I've got it, I've got it, I've got it, I've got it, I've got it."
"I got the whole set and the date of 2020 production, and the sound was fine for me, and if I wanted to activate the warrants, I'd have to call Shackleton's operator and not be able to activate them directly on the web site."
"The standard store VNA, I spent some time with no problem, no lack of connection when I tried to listen to a little girl who was sitting away from me for a couple of hours."
"The standard VNA production of T7/2020 may be triggered, but Purchase Standard may be reported to be inventure, so all you need to do is get a call up to the Apple/202020. Note that the consultant can ask you to take a picture of tiki's bills including the Nudden Nudres tab (you will receive an e-mail to the email box after purchase)."
"It's very satisfying with Tiki's services, very quick purchases and fast delivery, just sitting at home and waiting for a delivery."
It's a good thing that the inside product is intact! Tiki should review her package form for high value products!
"Tiki travels extremely fast, puts the last night and gets the next afternoon, not like some high-value goods company that hasn't been seen all week, waiting for the big satle to have voucher to get a good discount."
It's beautiful.
"When we first bought our Noahpods, we had some little problems, we got some tech stuff, we had no problems, we called in tiki, we talked about it, and they contacted us to help fix it, and they offered new products to us very quickly, but after we clicked it again, I told you that we didn't need any change, so we're still doing four months of good work, and we're still doing the same thing, and we're doing the same thing, and we're doing the same thing, and we're doing the same thing, and then we're doing the same thing, we're gonna do the same thing, and we're gonna do the same thing, and we're gonna do the same thing, and we're gonna do the same thing, and then we're gonna do the same thing, and then we're gonna do the same thing?"
"Quick delivery, carefully packed, the whole set, the company itself, but what's with the warranty notice to 8/2/3023?"
"Tiki is packed carefully, Tikinow delivers super fast, it's auth after check."
"It's extremely satisfying. Sp has the perfect quality of the description, the sure package, the money and the fast delivery P/s: we don't have time to take the picture up."
"The main product, Tiki's packed carefully."
"When we received the Shipper's code check, I ordered the tiki now after 3 o'clock, and I bought thepod once on tiki."
"Good earsets, auth goods, fast delivery, thank you, tiki."
"It's expensive, it's sophisticated Apple, Tiki has an OTP code, so you don't trust the wrong person, you buy high value, you buy it, you buy it, it's better than the traditional store."
Put TikiNow on quick delivery in the morning... the company's main line (sx 2021) just has to call the operator to update the warranty date.
"The quick delivery from the table at 11 o'clock, scheduled for 14 o'clock, 1235 is to the r address, packed very carefully, professionally."
"The real goods, just like the ring vendor on Exeter, confirm the company's main product."
"It's been a year and a half, it's still good."
"And, seal. Check on the new autopsy site. I'm using an angiulo so I don't know if it's okay for the rest of my life."
"The delivery's fast, but it's not that fast, but it doesn't matter if it's good."
"It's possible that negative matter isn't as good as the other company's earpieces, but if you use an iphone, it's a great connection."
"Advantage: Batteries, hearing ears, vivid sounds, beautiful design, high-end supplies of VN/A should be the quality of peace! Downside: It's easy to fall, it's got to go deep in your ear (not knowing where you are or what's wrong), it's easy to grab dirt, it's going to be stuck inside a carton that's a bit difficult to clean up!"
"Buyed, connected, okay, wondering why it connects itself and took the name of the old headset... check s/n and other details is fine."
"carefully packed, quality good"
Every crime has to be called up* Apple 18001127 for the warranty.
"Simple, efficient design, which makes it very comfortable to wear and very difficult to fall."
Quick delivery. The new product just came in to activate itself.
"I've spent two weeks and I haven't seen a problem, tiki trick."
"Okay checkout line is right, synchronization, no delivery is less than a day late than notice."
"I evaluated tiki's new delivery so fast that it was okay at first, I don't know if there was any problems in the future, but I don't know if there's been any trouble with the warrants."
"It's very satisfying and it's easy for me to be successful, and it shows you how to do it yourself!"

"Sp was the right shipment of goods, fast delivery, in the province that the next morning was delivered."
"The current hearing is fine, but let Tiki recheck my payment because apparently it's a successful payment, but the bank still reports that it's all collected in one month."
"Fast delivery for two hours, the delivery officer is eager to pack a nice package, the tikis let themselves check out the warranty is always awesome, generally extremely pleased."
"The new headset was produced in 2024, which was the latest airware, which wasn't to be ignored."
"Quick delivery, daily delivery, new boxes, new sets, ktras don't activate the warranty yet, but the battery's missing, let's take some time."
"Apple's main, Rat ok"
"It's a big, nice, solid product, bought it at the time of death, so it's a good offer, and now it's a good thing to take it all the way back to the store."
It's 100 percent raw and it's connected to the mobile phone.

"Jaqen's main product, which is fine, tiki delivers fast."
Good.
"The company's main goods, fast delivery, right now there's no sign of error, there's no problem, there's no problem with the quality of the goods, there's no package, there's not a box open, there's no shock, there's not a box like this, there's not a check for each box, there's not an update for Mr. shipper to drop his box from the car."
"Hi Tiki, I order every September 9th of September, and please check for me that why does ktram the serial number on the box tell me that it's warranty until May 2022."
"Airpods can't connect to the official iphone. The first connection is to tell thepod not mine. The next time you put your ear in the Airpod charge box, it's all asking for a self-connection, it's annoying, and the headset in the charge box is very loud."
Okay.
"I bought my product on November 10th, but three days have not been connected to shipper's income, and I don't know when I'll be able to get my product back."
"The left earpiece can't hear, and the right ear can't reach the right ear, but the other Airpod is fine, thanks to Tiki's response to this case soon!"
"Apple own goods, but we need to contact Apple VN (8001126) to supply TIVI's bills to update the purchases and maintenance times and wait for two days to complete, and we've been activated on Apple's server since May 2021."
"One, very bad purchase experience, put Tki Now delivered on October 14.10, set 1050, 1826 p.m. pressmen couldn't deliver, asked for delivery to the next day or Monday, no matter what."
"The brand-new product produces 8/2020, checks the barcode, but the payment was made, the shippers didn't call, handed it to their own family, and took the name of the product that they received in the picture, and suggested that Tiki work again with the Transporter."
Don't automatically connect to the headset.
"Tiki advertises to be 100 percent new to the company for a year, but having just received a package to Apple's website just checked out that it's only a three-month warranty or existing goods, I don't know if there's anything else to deal with, or if it's over."
"[Phone and really bad] The product that's been on the market today has to be contacted on its own for a very long time. To confirm that it has to have an account ioslave. must accompany the purchase bill. The processing process is 2-5 days. If you buy something that you meet, then I'm going to ask Tiki to change the product immediately for further inconvenience."
"The maintenance service is too boring, it's only been in February, it's still on board, it's off-line, it's off-site, it's off-line, it's off-limits, it's off-limits, it's off-line hearing, it's off-side, it's on one side, it's on one side, it's on the other side, it's on the other side, it's on the other side."
"When the purchases are opened, put them in the left-shaped caserole, without carefully checking the box when you return home to get more ipad connections before you see the scratch."
"Buying Christmas gifts for his wife, delivered on December 9th, 2020, triggered maintenance through Apple, but by noon 16th, 2020, his left ear was dead, and his sound was released."
"I've bought this product, and I've trusted to buy with Tiki Trading in hopes of a better mode of maintenance, but it's not that."
The delivery is faster than expected.
"I thought there were lots of touch modes once in a while, and I hit twice, but no, it turns out there's only one mode, and the sensors aren't there, and I'm on the street trying to get a call, and I don't know if this is going to work, right?"

"I don't know what's the reason why the airpod triggered the warranty from 070,2022, and then it's 7/06/2023, and the tiki newspaper called for the maintenance product by the bill, but Shackleton kept telling us to look at it. For a while, it says ""Nt"", and updates will write later! Anw, the ear is fine, the ear is good, the delivery is quick, the package is a little sketchy."
"I've been getting it for over a week now that I've found it on top of my ear, there seems to be a crack, I haven't dropped it or anything, hoping to get it from tiki."
"The delivery was fast on Saturday, but somehow when one of the right ear opens up, there's a stain on the other end, and it's not as hard as the left ear, does anyone know where the tiki connection is?"
"I've been getting this morning but I've been using or losing connection, amputating with a sudden off, hearing at the wrong time, the sound doesn't balance with non-sympathetic click."
"The hearing ear can't be used in less than a week. <i>We can't do it online.</i> <i>This is a failure.</i> <i>Tenki Kei's connection is a backup, but nothing is found.</i> <i>It's a boring business to buy onl.</i>"
"I put this product up and I got this product on March 20, 2021, and I took the product's serials on the ioslave to check and activate the warranty, and as a result, I saw that my product had already been activated?"
"The company itself, okay, securely buys whole seal, but the function of touching two times to switch the cards isn't sensitive, I reach the 10th time it's been forwarded, not expecting much of this function."
"This is an electronic product that I bought in electronics, and at the end of the day, it's now heard people say that life is boring without news, but today has come true."
"Thanks to Tiki's support in exchange, the right ear is bigger than the left, and the left is smaller, and I'm afraid of buying import goods for this reason, and it's more than 600k to buy the main store, and who thinks it's the same thing, and the ear stick looks like a toy, and it doesn't work very well."
"The correct use of one year is a broken ear, and for me, 3 million dollars to spend a year on a single electronic product is not worth paying."
"I've been using less than a month, but there's two problems with products: (1) Airpods and battery charge gone too fast (faster with Airpods 2) I bought it directly from Apple), and (2) a few days ago, one ear ear that can't handle an iPhone, can't use it, although it's a full battery."
"I'm putting in an unrecognizable order, and I'm not putting in a bill, and I'm often going to put in a paper bill, but now I'm not doing that."
"Hi Tiki, I've got the shipment this afternoon and everything's on the right-hand side."
"Hey, guys and Tiki, I've got Airpod test on Apple's Web site but it's showing like this."
"The product's okay, except for the smog, which is okay, but it's okay to use the mentor's feature to know the date of purchase and update on the ioslave, and then the counselor says, ""Wait for the technician to come back."" And the technician says, ""You can't check"" and then send it back to me, and then he's gonna call Apple, and then he's going to give me the receipt, and then he can't talk to anyone else."
"Buy 20 months, 2022 stars, 2412,2021."
"Hi tiki I just bought from you on January 25,21 p.m."
"Six months is spent listening to computer connections at no time, the charge box is not charged until the next day the battery is dead."
"It's because I'm waiting for a month to receive the package, and I'm waiting for tiki to send in my bill so I can't get it back."
"Fast delivery after one day, and check seral takes a month's notice."
"I bought it one day, I used it the next day, I sat around to see if the hinges were wrong, I closed them up, I covered them with liquids from the hinges, I had this cry stuck when I touched the case, I don't know if there was any trouble in this case, and if there was any warranty, or if this was a general error for all the product, I hope to get the chopport on Tiki."
"When you have received an open row, your earphones have failed to receive a signal, show a flash of blue. Reset has failed to hold 15 seconds, the signal only moves to white without blinking. Hopefully the tiki side will be able to help."
"I just bought one, but I'm sorry that one of my left ear plugs into the battery, and I can't charge it, and I've called TiKi, and I've got a date, and then I've got a T3, and I've got no contact with the guests, and I'm calling them, and I'm calling them, and I'm saying, ""I don't know."
"I bought it at 3.330k, which is fine. The real VNA, too, is over-expressive, has to be called up to the VNFN operator, which takes two hours to solve, and then the right side to the sake of Singapore, which is something that's supposed to keep me on notice for 12 months, which is over 340 hours of fine quality calls, which is a familiar feature that has no argument whatsoever."
"Advantage: Fast, fast-linking equipment, which is available for all non-verbal devices, hey siri does not need to touch, full-time charge, 15-20 minutes is that it hears: bad noise, sound doesn't sound much better than the ones with many strings, lot of ear pain, hey siri in the noise condition that's not working, cate's easy to scratch."
"I bought Airpods just over a month, I spent the first few days, then my right ear didn't produce sound. The battery that was on my right ear was only 50 percent while charging it in the box at the same time. The device didn't connect to the phone. Because Tiki was convinced to accept expensive sp, the quality was too bad, and it didn't look as good as expected."
"Buying your girlfriend, experience is normal, like having Apple's wire. Airpods pros are better and better, except for a star. 2 o'clock buys at 8.30am, but it's less than 1.30 pm before you get anything."
"Well, that sounds pretty good. All the functions are good, but checking to activate the warranty aren't working, and seeing the warranty lucky until March 2023."
Sorry product can't hear one side of it.
"It's okay, but shipper delivers without any identification, please. Tiki chose shipper more properly."
The product's battery's down.
"The delivery is fast, but just activated, and the warranty has 10 months left, or has been activated before."
"I've rarely been able to buy electronics through the floor because I've been so concerned about the maintenance problem that this time, because I've been under trial, and I've never been satisfied, but I hope that Tiki gets the goods and buys not only the visual part but also the software that's wrong, she's connected and reflected with the images and clips, but also received the goods, and she's hoping that Tiki gets the goods, she's eager to buy, and she's using Tkinow to get the goods, and then three days now she's been sitting in a box waiting for protection, and she's picking out the lines instead of the goods, and she's still not happy."
How do you contact the owner of the shop to check or preserve the product?
"I can't connect with my left ear, I don't know how I can do this, I don't know how I can get my left ear covered."
"Tiki's delivery is a little slow, the hinges aren't very sure, and it's recommended that if you buy them, you buy them with a bag right away, because hops are easy to scratch."
"I've got sp, goods. Okay, I've been using for almost 10 days, but I've been on the phone, and I've been on the phone, and I've been on the phone, and I've been on the air, and I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, but Tiki needs to check in on the buyers's aid."
"Fast delivery, new Sd, so undiagnosed, no accompanying receipts, and just how do we look at the Main/A goods, and activate the warrants?"
"2 plus: quick delivery, raw sequence minus: small sound, activated electronic traffic from t8/21 while buying November, chat chat tvvv has not yet received a press response."
"I just bought three days, but today my battery's gone."
"How come you can't check the product's maintenance date, check the code, you don't have any information to buy?"
It's pretty good. We haven't had it in long enough.
"I'm charging my left ear with a lost source, and then once I can charge it for a while, if I turn on my ear, it's still charging, even though it's off."
Why does the warranty run out of two months compared to the day we bought it?
"Fast delivery, but I called to activate the warranty. No one picked up the phone. The buyers, nsx, should be in touch with the guests to activate."
Temporarily monitor this sp ntn
"I've just opened the box on January 13,21, but my warranty package is only 25/2021, but normally it's going to be one year."
"Mik doesn't know if it's Mik or not, but as far as mik knows, Airpod 2 calls, you don't need to press twice, you don't understand why mik can't call a serial."
"Tiki should review the customer and the delivery services at 2 o'clock! set the quick 2 o'clock delivery service but conclude it's after 4 o'clock, in front of the front page and the next step to 2 o'clock but the last step is to change into the next 4 o'clock, so advertising and actually cutting each other up to 50 percent of the service, call the agent cskh to support the address because you're still in a package situation, the answerees you can only support 30 minutes earlier, the address will not change when you don't have the next few days and you've got the idea that you're going to buy the same thing and then you don't have the same idea that you're not really going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to deliver to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to"
"It's very small and it's very light, it's normally not much like a hand attached to it, but it's got something that doesn't have a string that's stuck, and it's important that the wire gets dirty or broken after half a year."
"The product has been involved with Tiki at least five times to return the goods and the answer is to pick up the slowest cargo after 48 hours, send an email that doesn't come back, and now it's been 10 days since the first call, why is this receiving so much time when the delivery is only two hours later?"
It's boring to buy tiki.
Connect to Event but several times later are “not your Airpod ” and“ Share Audio Dyer is very annoying.
"Trustful and buying in Tiki, but over the last two products, it's too bad the response client doesn't have any backup, no connection to the damn thing, you don't have to sell it and then you're done."
Let me ask you why she's so ill. I bought it on the 15th.
"I've been listening for half a month, but my left ear can't hear me, and I've tried a lot of different ways, but I can only hear my ears at the same time."
"The main purchase on June 21, 1980, July 15,19, due to failure on his left ear was often disconnected, even though the two - ears batteries were always on 92%. On July 18, 1980, Tiki sent an e-mail to send the product back after work day after work; today it's 29/07/2019 after three phone calls, but it's all about waiting and apologizing."
Why is the new product that Airpods have named like this?
"The product that's connected at zero, the connection is off-line."
"I've been buying airpods for 2 days, and I've seen what it's like to be on the air in May 25th and 2022?"
I just bought this airpod 2. I don't know where this stuff came from. I don't know where it came from.
"It's okay with the warranty. Why did I buy that November 16th,2021, which was just 25th,2022?"
"The cost ear to the charge does not go into the case, the charge only goes into the ear ear, the cate forever, and it sends you a request to return the package."
"Batteries are as sensitive as any of the other airpods, but theirs is long gone, open the lid, it doesn't connect itself in all its forms, throws them across one side of the next connected normally."
"Fast delivery, wait to see whether it's apod1 or a pods2. Let's fix the evaluation after the results."
"The delivery's as fast as a storm, hjj."
"The good packaged product, the whole set, the quality OK, the warranty is a year away, but it was a month ago."
"This product is five months ahead, people have to call the Apple VN support reactivated, boring."
Ask Tiki to give me my stuff. I'll buy Airpod 2 not one of us. We'll give you one for two.
"Rating two, because tiki now, delivery doesn't work like a commitment."
"I've bought one month, but the right side has lost the signal, I've tried to unmount it, I can't figure it out."
There's no way to know the charge is charged.
"Buying from today, March 3rd,2022, but the warranty term for December 30th,2022 -- asked me to get a new machine back on time for a year's notice."
"Buying VN/A higher prices eventually gets the KH/A code costing time, so stop spending the warehouses. Need more attention about getting the onions."
"Case's bin fell from 90 to 20 after one night even though it's just earpieces, so it's only one charge to the headset."
"Sp k has a warrant for one year, just bh to 2/2/2023."
It's kind of a bad match. I've heard four days of seeing it. It's a bit of a mess.
"I've just bought this airpod that's been waiting for a few days, and I'm sending it to Tiki, hoping to get an early response from tiki."
The red light flashed continuously and could not connect to my iphone
"The package has already been stored, the connection already has a previous username, the warranty is down to 5/2022. Disillusioned with Tiki."
"New product buys it, but there's an ear failure on the right ear. It's not going into the battery. It's not going to be able to hear it."
"Tiki's delivery service is OK, and the product experience is too bad, the error product is not working, Apple Vietnam's proxy policy holds the product for 15 days to test it."
"I still haven't received an electronic bill, Tiki check for my bill."
Sonic error on the left.
"I don't know if it's a bad system, but I can't afford to spend any more time buying it."
"The hearing is okay but it's too hard to activate the warranty instead of doing anything simple, because the reason not to activate the warranty makes a lot of people wonder."
"What do you mean, we're gonna pay for it and then we're gonna send out a bank card and we're gonna pay for it and then we're gonna pay for it?"
It's good. It's good. It's good.
"received the package, but I can't tell the difference between the real goods, recommending my support."
"Okay, I'm sorry for the poor sound method, but if you use Sony to move in, you should consider buying Airpods pro."
"What do you mean, you don't see the number of series in a box like the one on the Internet?"
"The ear's broken, no one's listening."
"The quality of the product, the delay of the delivery was due to translation, and the operators had an unsolicited attitude."
Connect to the MAbook or get lag.
"You know, after a few weeks of use, you see, when you turn up the volume, it's a little awkward."
"Let me ask you, what's the difference between the box and the charge box, but what's the difference between the two ears?"
"Why did my ears just buy it, activate the warranty and then listen only to one ear at a time?"
"Standard delivery, quick delivery, carefully packed."
"I just bought this box and I had an ear open, and I asked the salesmen to give it to me!"
I hope Tiki sees and responds.
"It's full box, but when it's available, it's 87 percent left, and it's 76 percent left."
"It's a matter of keeping your money for months, not seeing the goods, not paying for it, not even with a lot of reflections."
It's very hard to connect to the antlers.
"Quick delivery, enthusiastic personnel, slight loose ends, steady headsets, no delays."
The paper box is torn
Why can't we check the warranty time?
There's a four-month warranty.
I can hear you for a few minutes and there's no clear signal.
Use it well.
"Inadequacies, cataracts, earpieces."
It's been a month since I've used it. I've lost one ear.
The product's name is Airpod 2 which gets Airpod 1?
send shit to tiki but do not receive feedback to activate the warranty
"All right, let's go. Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go!"
"The package's fine, but it's still not registered."
The cable doesn't charge Airpods.
It's still pretty good to use right now.
"First used properly, but about two weeks later, only left ear, right ear, no more sound, although the leopard was already out."
"To buy a whip, a male da wa, Wadgers' coral quell:"
It's been too long. It's been too bad because of the other orders.
How can I check that I can't confirm the date of my purchase?
"Tiki delivers as quickly as possible, packed carefully, but can both ears be used equally but disparated by batteries to 10 percent?"
"It's good to buy after a while. The box he's got won't last much longer with his earpiece, he's been jerked off once in a while."
Sound's normal.
"I bought it. I can't activate the warranty, thanks to tiki's support."
Too tired of the BAO error product to return send unplugged headsets really disappointed
Not far enough to catch the signal.
"When the earpieces are turned on, there is no display of the battery of the headsets and boxes."
The delivery time is slower than expected.
The hinges are pretty loose.
"Batteries are weak, batteries, batteries, batteries, batteries, batteries."
It's loose. It's delivered fast.
Not as good as my first headset.
My red bill when I bought this sp.
Text shop non-supported

Case has tea.
"Quick delivery, a rather complicated issue of warranty."
"The company's main product, but the glue between the two details spreads out a little bit, so it's not locked up for the rest of it. Okay."
Payback error long - long money
"Let me ask you how to activate the warranty, and when I buy, I don't see any delivery coupons."
"The company itself, the quality, the box is intact."
"Can only hear the left side, please ask for the warranty address?"
The package was activated two months ago.
It's okay. It's not really perfect.
Also bt
No sign of tiki's connection to the warranty trigger.
"Sp sometimes right ear can't hear you, sp funbox, reasonable price"
Great.
"Don't activate the warranty, expect backup from tiki."
Good.

"Set this morning, deliver it in the afternoon, and make a quick connection."
"Hand over the cave quickly, with fine envelopes"
Good.

Standard Row
"I think it sounds good, after I charge Full of boxes, I can use two days."
"M had to experience three months to look at the durability, the sound, the sound, the sound, on average, okay, but the point is it's going to be more than 20 minutes, maybe it's going to be a problem in style design."
"Nice headsets, great sound company, fast delivery like a shop."
"It's good, I'm good, because I haven't read the instructions carefully. Everyone buy carefully and read the products."
"Good quality, nothing bad, cheap price."
"The product's okay, the battery's long-term, it's good at the price, and this is a long time to see how long it takes to hold a battery, not all of it, but it's a good seven o'clock job."
"The real tense bass, the 90 percent battery, and 80 percent, and the 7 o'clock ad wasn't very sure."
"Worth buying, I used to buy an earpiece at CellphoneS for 700k, but it didn't last as long as this kid, and it's worth more than expected. And the money, thank you for the store."
"The quality of sound is clear, beautiful, thank you, Tiki."
Saigon ok ah deliver quickly package carefully
"The quality of sound is good, the batteries are long-term."
Oh... you should buy it!!!!!!!
"Fast delivery, well packed, nice sp"
Good hearing hearing sounds or something higher than shoppe
It's beautiful. It's okay.
Bass is fine.
"It's okay, it's quick and it's nice."
Much better than the price.
Fine.
"It's okay, it's my favorite purple, it's a lot of shop support."
"As far as feeling's concerned, OK. Tq's and chssst's are mine."
The sound is sound at a price range.
"Be careful with the package, the price is reasonable."
My wife says it's okay.
"It's good music, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good."
"Sharp quality of sound, warm bass."

Good stuff.
The full product works well.
I don't know how long it's been at first.
"It's irresponsible, it's unreputable, it's unreputable."
"All right, let's use the battery."
"It doesn't sound good, it sounds a little loud."
Fine quality
"The exact same row, to use the time to view this mouse line ntn"
Like
The rat's not buying in three months.
"The delivery was long and sympathetic. The package was packed thoroughly, but the outside box was crushed with good mouse quality, soft clicks and gnarly, with dpi-adjusted software and diverse lights."
"Top mouse, used before using G102 Prodigy for 3 years, had a three-year problem with the right mouse. Now this is a cheap starter. The main mouse gets app LgiHub. However, it's probably because of electronic traffic, so I don't see stamps. I've set them for a long time to deliver (more than a month). They're still giving five stars."
"The brand itself is received immediately, with firm hands, with good use, fast delivery, well packed goods, good quality products, good prices compared to quality."
"Yeah, real good. Got the Ighug software very sensitive, but it's a little small-handed."
"Good mouse, if ghub is up to 3,000dpi max, have to load ghubs on it, light, beautiful, fast delivery shop."
Tiki Tranding has just been booked and is now delivered!
"Buying this one is the second, smooth, sensitive, and sustainable."
"The white mouse is very nice, the sensor key, the average click is not too big or too smooth, and the middle mouse wheel is not too big for you. The Autocad clicks in between aren't bad with your fingers, but the mouse is used for games, so it's a bit of a pain in the finger when it's used and it's high in common. Everything that's left is equal to the price of money."
"Fast delivery, even though I'm at the bd but one day it's the end of the day."
"Thanks to my mouse game, I've been so obsessed with my team that I don't know how many times."
"Borrowed, sensitive, pretty long, easy to connect."
Placed goods on the market should be slow delivery but well packed! Logitech is very firm in his hand and the color changes in the dark catch his eye.
beautiful products that can change colors on applications have many Ied and pretty Ied modes that can touch at will
"A good mouse at the price range, has the software to customize the buttons and lights, ae to the homeloger's tabowow down."
"First thing I have to say is that the delivery is fast, and App said it's a week before you get it, and two days before you get it."
"I've never been disappointed in the product from Tiki, especially Tiki Trading."
It's beautiful.
"I bought a third mouse that used four to four to four to four years, so I double-clicked it."
"Quick delivery, real mice that interact well with ghub, hope the quality is stable as long as advertising."
"Light Mouse, the upper mouse supports the speed of the mouse pointer. Mouse fit, not too small. Mouse OK."
I don't know if tiki's mouse is an electronic warranty or something.
Ok delivery's pretty fast. Five days during the beautiful mouse season. You should buy a sale.
"Good, good, logs are not going to work, fast delivery bla blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah."

Led's beautiful.
Good stuff.

"Fast delivery, nice mouse, rgb can be adjusted by software. DPI Maximum 8,000. The string is quite long, comfortable for ae to use PC at the bottom of the foot."
"I bought this one because I'm using gene one, and I hope there's no double clicks."
Oke Oke oke oke oke oke oke oke
Very fine. Use it well. You can use the app to fix the lights and DPI
"Well done. For nearly a year, no unusual phenomena have been seen. The series pasted on the other side of the series on the mouse."
"The message box is distorted, the minimal mouse has given 5 stars for making quick delivery"
"Quick delivery, I'll buy 10-tenth salad and 285K too priceed for the market."
"When you use it, it's a seven-ball rainbow. It's so smooth, it's so smooth, it's generally pretty cool to buy when it's done, it's a few decades down."

"Logore's off the table on salary, loud click rat for brothers who like the sound of the voice, tiki checkding delivered quickly without saying best."
The box outside but inside the package ensures that the new mouse buys good use yet thy strength must take time to find out.
"Tiki is always good, fast"
"It's cheap, it's thin, it's two weeks of use, so it's not clear if Double clicks are made, but G102 models of Logotech are very likely to make this mistake."

The package's pretty ok. The guy who uses it after hours is fine and can contact and preserve if there's an accident.
"This beautiful, smooth-cut product, full box, adjust DPI speed, fine. Thank you, shop."
Good.
Ten dollars worth of rice money. Shoots csgo looks like mouth. It doesn't match anything the kid wants to go pro game.

"The electronic goods that, in the course of delivery that got hit like this, don't know what the product was doing inside, there wasn't any protective pads, and the delivery was very slow, so working with the delivery unit, very disappointed about this order of tiki."
"Rats are delicious, fit at a price range."

Okay.
Fine within the price range.
"This G102 is beautiful, and it's cool."
"The first delivery party was too rough, and the delivery was too long, and the mouse was not identical to the other one. It started out with two lines on the tail of the mouse that thought it was a crack, but thought it was design. The second one was the S/N code on the box, and on the mouse didn't match the other. Third: Ghub of Ghub of Ghubtech identified the mouse. Changes the colors, the macro color, etc., ""P"", ""P"" and ""P"" on the end of the warrants"" and ""D"" -- and ""D"" without any further questions."
"Sensitive Mouse, beautiful led, good game"

"It's only been more than a month since we've been bought on March 2006, 2021, that rats often lose a signal that can't be moved in a second, try a lot of web plugs that still have."
Digiworld Imports. The box and beautiful mouse form. The connection is good and configable to G Hub. Except 1* SN on the mouse does not match SN in the box but is printed on a pasted decal (some importing NPP instead SN?).
"There is no sign of digiworld on the box. Check the maintenance on the digiworld site using theboal number outside the box. Use presently no problem. The package only has a paper box outside the product box, no sponge or air wrap to protect the product from the dam. Fortunately, the beautiful package is still unmodified, no apparent phenomenon."
"1. The product is already using 102 older copies, so it's still familiar with pawning and quality is okay, Ied is better than the old one. Hopefully not double-click like the old one 2. The point is that between the mouse and the box is not identical, and the box is also open before delivery but probably the stamp should be OK. The serial number between the box and the mouse body is not duplicate but I have checked on the spring distribution page is exactly the same sp. The dealer has an explanation, so this point should be accepted. The check is usually the check when the check is typed on g, then it's only going to go to the world, into speg. if you don't want to have a permanent check for the last 12 years or 20 years't know if you want to go on your journey."
"- I've been trying to figure out when I bought it. - the last time I bought a bag that didn't have a check, but I think it's probably because of the tiki now."
"The next three days is ok, the box is unmoved, and the mouse is scratched doesn't make any sense while the whole set (but one star). The mouse clicks well, get ghub."
"The mouse was taken OK, sensitive, but shipper from Tiki's side of the delivery didn't understand the rush or whatever, threw the load at him from a six-foot shot to his face, didn't apologize to him."
"This is the second G102 mouse I bought from tiki, and it's very disappointing that a week left mouse has had a paralysis."
"The delivery experience was worse than getting products, boxes, and insides, which were more than half wet, and it was almost like being crushed or thrown out of the corner, so that the product could still be used normally."
"Hi, I bought a G102 mouse, and after one day I found the product's error in the LED strip, let's say Tiki's handling the case."
"The number of seriess in boxes and on different products, Tiki runs by electronic bills, but the number of seriess on the bills is out of the box, so how do you store it after that?"
"The product has this particular embassy output problem is that the number of boxes and mice that don't match on the check, the number of series doesn't match."
"I rated a star so that the mouse will improve its delivery. The problem is that it's slow transport (the next two days as soon as it's delivered, even though it's called up to Best Express, it's been approved and supported.) but the first delivery officer is very bored, did I first call ahead because he didn't see how close it is to dark?"
"The delivery partner for tiki was too slow, but he ran out of time, and he was in jail for a long time, and he moved from SG - BRVT; then he went back to jail when shipper got the goods, and he was rude, and when he got the offer to get it all the way, he got it hard, and he didn't see it, and he went back three days."
"When the delivery comes in, the shell is disfigured, even if it's glued to broken words outside, so is inside the box of mice."
"It's about 25/1021, today 25/2021 in a two-month period. The mouse has double-clicking conditions. And drag and focus don't exactly affect my work."
"Model G102 lightsync that app reports G203 Lightsync, blinks without receiving a mouse"
It's a disfigured box of goods.
"The product is packed carefully, and it's been in business for quite some time, and it's got exactly the same G102 Lightsync, which is the first time the mouse experience of logologol feels pretty good."
"The mouse's fine, the mouse's right hand, the mouse's a very strong country mouse, and it's able to put a light to its will on ghub."
"Did we buy June 2022 because of the double click failure, or did we get the warranty?"
"It's only been 157 months and it's been a heavy double-click, the mouse's only used for mailage videos, not many videos, but double-clicked already, really disappointed."
"Mouse spends more than three months already in trouble, left mouse hold button no longer eats. Draws straight lines that break in between."
"I didn't get the package, and after two days Tiki didn't know if she had given it to anyone or who had given it to her, the other quality is far from the Tiki that the buyer had believed in, if the buyer had stopped paying for it first."
"It's pretty, but, uh, I don't have a warranty stamp yet, so let me ask you if you'll be in touch with the warranty."
"Nice mouse, but it's the same company, but it's got a little bit of a ""star"" box."
I've bought a few days already with double click left mouse. Now how'd it go back to tiki?
Mouse is quite good; the link to Ghub has the color led. Mouse moves quite smooth. Rcm mn should buy
"Is this p row size????? already opened before, the other P/N number?"
"Everything's good, it's just annoying, the mouse's too sensitive, the finger's too light, right-clicking, it's always worth four stars."
S/N and P/N parts of the box shell and mouse shell are not the same.
"As soon as I hit the box, everything was fine except for the loud click I used in the middle of the night, which was pretty uncomfortable."
I don't think he's used to it.
"Rats are good, get ghub."
Saigon has double-clicked for a month.
"The delivery was fast and the package was beautiful, but the mouse was scratched."
"If we use it for almost a year, scroll's got a problem!"
"Rats use very hard hands, they're not comfortable moving, they don't require much."
"In general, OK. Mouse calls click not the silent click line, 2 keys must not be uncustomed because Mac doesn't have apps like Logotech."
"Having a mouse for a long time, it's hot in the log-log zone."
Over a year's use has failed.
"Main mouse but too slow, normal delivery from HCM to the Pacific takes a week to move."
"Using less than a year mouse has double-clicked, rolled, now the warranty doesn't know who it is!"
"Borrowed, but the sensitivity's unstable."
"Rats can handle it, but there's not a lot of refinements like Fulhen."
"The speed of moving is slow, it's very uncomfortable. The mouse's made a mistake."
"Okay, okay, okay."
"The rat's pretty good, quality product, except for the light paint when you pick it up."
"The ghub could not be installed, so dpi only made it to 3,000."
The price goes up higher than the normal price and the price goes down.
"Good shot, good price fits."
I don't know if it's a disease effect.
It's okay.
"The mouse won't last long. double-click, boring."
The quality's pretty good. Okay. No problem yet.
"The product failed to accept installation, recover the product, but it took too long to deliver the mouse to himself"
"The initial feeling is good, the use takes more time."
"The mouse is sensitive, fast, but the strength is so poor, it's only been double-clicked for a few months."
"Good use, no problem."
The quality goods aren't there any problems.
Mouse is good at using but key clicks have not really started yet
The delivery was less than a month before the package was delivered.
Can't install win11 yet. It's been a while.
The RBG lights are 16 million. They look really good.
"It's all right. During the trade season, it's a little too long."
hard dow load software for win7
Time of travel is too long.
"OK, fine, but theship's a little slow."
"Rats are a bit stiff, they don't sound good."
It's too long to deliver. Ten days to deliver.
"It's okay, but it's been a while."
Why aren't you getting a log signal?
It's been a while since we've been on the move. Okay.
The delivery is slower than the appointment.

"I choose the fast shipper that's very cute. You see that before the time you've established the system, you've called me to wait for a store, which is very thoughtful, and you're very well-used today. It's cute. Your ears are warm, your ears are warm. You've heard the sound of Pin for a long time."

"Quick delivery shop, thanks shop."

"The battery, it's beautiful, but the earpiece only hears one side. I'm wearing a lot of pain, and I'm very, very uncomfortable. It's not a phone device that I'm testing two or three phones."
"The quality will respond after a time of use, and it won't be a problem at the moment."
The delivery is fast. It's got a good hip.

"Buying mostly to open the hdmi gate to open the screen, and it's less than three months ago that the hdmi gate didn't come in, it's moving much, it's just sticking it together, it's texting the shop for innovation, but it's three times since there's no change at all, and with this quality and maintenance, we're contributing one star, and there's no durability."
"Mount in, OK, and install properly."
"All right, let's go. Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go!"

A caring delivery worker
"It's normal, it's not brilliant, but it's okay with the price."
It's very smooth. It's easy to move a mouse with a piece of underwear. So buy one.
Very pleased.
I'm very sure.
"It's simple, it's simple, it's smooth, it's good, it's delivered pretty fast."
Okay.

"The delivery came up late one day, the notice came up on Wednesday and didn't show up until noon on Thursday, didn't see any change from tiki, and then I got back to Tiki a while ago, but I was a little disappointed."
"It's better if you don't stick a log of a cappella in it, so it's the right brand, and it's kind of funny."
"It's smooth, it's small, it's cool, it's expensive, it's bad, it's bad, it's bad, it's bad, it's bad, it's kind of rough, but I'm pretty good."
Slow delivery that confirms the tiki system is on time?
The delivery guy's late.
It's bad and expensive.
I'm feeling a little small.
You don't really have a bad signal.
"The outer border's not protected, so it's easy to blow up."
"I've been picking up watches since morning and I'm not ready to hit them, and I've got boxes, and I've got batteries in my watch. Like app watch, and I've got a clock that's cheaper than a shot, and I've lost my battery, and I've tried my watch, so let's just say that's okay."
It's as good as Mjxancnapaccocococaxax.
That's a good match for the device.
"Quick delivery, good joints."
"Tiki speedship 2 o'clock, that's good."
Good.
It's not working for the iPhone.
"Clip it still says the signs are charged, but so that from dark to morning, no more percent, and another charge is normal, expensive, wastes of time."
"I bought the wrong package, gave the name name name name unknown, then put the type C wire on it, then charged it off the power, so I couldn't keep it in check, so I didn't expect to buy it."
"Sometimes it's okay, you suck, don't sell that kind of shit."
"Bad quality, nearly a month gone by."
"It's not the battery, it's the company itself."
We're good. The equipment's not tight.
"It's been a long time since you've bought this model, and you're lucky that the satle has dropped quite a bit, and the overall size is large, but it's still small compared to your hand, and the click of the mouse is almost invisible."
"I've been using short time and feeling sp very gently press, absolutely no sound on the click, absolute level of oscillation."
"The delivery took a couple of days, close to the kidney, enough goods, the right samples, the quality of the product, to confirm it, but it's generally OK."
"Good, smooth, soundless, smooth, handsy, two weeks without problems."
"The package is exactly the same, the whole set, the Tiki package with the label on it, so it's very reassuring, the quality of the product, the quality of the product."
"The house doesn't have space, so it has to be in the bedroom, when the wife is napping or at night clicking is screaming, so the mouse responds to the soft needs."
"Sp is the right description, the whole stamp, the carefully packed package, the quality of the time to know the hope of a stable use."
Good mouse. Okay. Good hand.
"Ok Main mouse pride, soft and light press no noise"
"It's very good. Everyone, the signal's smooth. No sign, no palms, no palms."
"You should buy it, it's as soft as a description."
"This one's got nothing to discuss. I've already had four of them, but one of them is out of warranty, and the other one's out of line, and the right one's out of luck."
"Fast delivery, well-used mouse, medium-handed mouse-compatible sylle, but the accompanying income isn't an unify head."
"The mouse is smooth, the whole box, and the side is plastic, which is different from M331, which wraps the anti-slip rubber, but it's fast, hopefully more sustainable: D Tiki delivers super fast, for five stars."
"Nice, sensitive, easy to use"
"The mouse press is very smooth, it almost doesn't listen to the sound when you click, the beautiful design is between hand and hand, the move is very small."
"The press key is very smooth, there's hardly a click, there's a hurry. Use a battery AA. It's basically OK."
"The package's a little rough, but, fortunately, no effect on the inside, my hands are a little big, so the mouse doesn't fit, and the black one's fine."
"Great product quality, very nice, very sure packaged product, very good service, very valuable money, relatively fast delivery time."
"It's very good, it's very good, it's very comfortable, it's very comfortable, it's also good for people who work long times with mice, it's going to be great; it's going to be buying on long-term tiki."
"The mouse is smooth, bought for the third time, so there's nothing to talk about."
"Rats are sensitive, they fit, they're not loud."
"Mouse is smooth, no click sounds. A little faster than the old mouse is just a little bit faster than the speed it uses."
"I've bought a similar one on the shop but it's no longer as clean as Tiki, I've evaluated the quality of the 5th product and the quality of Tiki 5"
"It's not loud, it's really good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's expensive, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good."
"I'd say that's way too good for the store outside. The quality's off the table, and before I use m220 to convert to m330, I'd say it's very smooth."
"It's great, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good."
It's a good product. It's a brand of manufacturers and vendors.
"Tiki is well packed, wrapped, nice, smooth, completely quiet, loglog Lion cheap and sustainable"
Oke Oke oke oke oke oke oke oke
Rats OK. You should buy the package. It's pretty careful with the delivery.
"I drew the sun. Your mouth was smiling, like a smile. Your teacher was singing. I taught me how to play."
"The delivery was super fast. I ordered it at 12:30, then 1350 got it in my hand."
"It's a bit smooth, the mouse seems to have no reputation, it's hard to move because it's too big for the girl's hands."
It's a perfect product. I'd love to make a quick delivery.

"The delivery is on time, the package is carefully packed, and the durability waits for the experience."
"Same pattern as the old M275, but this one is silent, and the mouse click is much smoother and no noise."
"It's very smooth, it'll buy."
Worth the Cost
"Heavy hands, smooth air, no sound"
The skeetacus has always given the user confidence.
"The rats are smooth, they're soft, they're smooth, they're smooth."
"But since the mouse is smooth, the price is right, it'll buy the right model."

I'd love to.

The main company mouse is comfortable holding your hands easy and not getting tired
Very Slient.
"Not used, but very good initial impressions."
You bought a while ago on your mistakes.

A real rat delivers fast.
"Fast delivery, sensitive rats, very good hands and soft hands, but I don't know how strong they are."
"Rats are smooth, they're delivered fast, but I don't understand, but the strength is waiting for more time."
"The mouse is good, the mouse is good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good."

"It's good to use it. It's early. It's a little short, but it's okay to use it."

"It's a nice packaged product with safe stamps, the initial experience is good."
It's a little small for the hand.
It's estimated that the price of satle is a bargain for the fast exchange of tikinow.
"The other day, the delivery was in order. The real rat didn't go off. He's got a dress, he's bought it a few times. It's a pleasure."

"The mouse was smooth, but when the line was lined up, the nice layer underneath was scratched, and it seemed like the fake line, because M330 had to have rubber pads around instead of solid plastic, I was quite concerned about the quality later:"

"The delivery is super fast, but the mouse appears to be breaking down on the left side."
"It's a good product that used to buy and use a BMCH, but Tiki Trading's sales quality is so bad, it's always like fucking clients."

The product's not damaged.
It's very loose. It's not about money.
"Pretty good quality, I'm sure, but the two bars are pretty sharp."
It's a little extra than two centimeters to the rubber pad.
Okay.
"If you leave a place where you can't move, okay, otherwise there's no pins, so when you move or you get supermodulators."
"It's a little tight, but it's all my money."

"It's a little rough, and it's a little disappointed for 200K."

To be limped is not the same height.
"Easy to use with multiple scales adjust the altitude, light materials. sp sure"

Okay.
That's all right.
Okay.
"It's a good thing it's not that easy to break, but even if it's out of the break-up box, it doesn't give a damn about transportation."
Go ahead with five stars because of the same supplier.
"The reading rate is good, as advertised, the package is packed carefully, the card is good."
"The product's got the right description, but it's not fast enough, so the price's good, the store's fast and it's packed carefully."
"The price was reasonable, the whole set sandisk, the durability unknown to the use of time."
Good quality.
"Trust me, enough fresh stuff, generally good at a price, buys the most scary memory cards selling virtual memory cards, especially on two apps for the first time buying on tiki and feeling pretty good."
"The good packaged product is a little bit longer than the other ones I've put into place. So I'm going to review, and hopefully the good tks tiki goods."
The package looks exactly like it. The format is 128g.
This memory card is pretty fast. It's 25mm per second. The press is 127.5 gb. I don't know if it's enough.
"Fast delivery, secure package, put it on the machine, format, and see the capacity of 119GB, which seems to be quality, and the quality of the package waits for the time to respond."
Packages were carefully packed and delivered quickly
"We've got the original card. 128 p.m. card, win 119gb. The quick reading card, copy 3.7g file in fast, buy to cbi later on, buy the orange."
"The company's main line, filled with sufficient capacity, high reading speed (a preliminary copy 1 gigabyte with several small files inside about 5GB missing less than 1p). The new shield was no sign of an open break."
"Copyed the information in the card and found: sufficient capacity, a slightly slower write-up rate than the ad, but accepted at the price of the money. The actual display was shown, ok, bought again the second time."
The goods cost a couple of times as much as they buy in a standard machine.
"The second one I bought, I don't know if it's worth anything, but the last one's been on the phone for almost two years."
"Tags, OK."
"Fast delivery, quality, pc tags, and cell phones are all received. 119G is enough."
"The image's not right, the memory card's all set, it's attached to the phone, it's supposed to be sustainable."

"We're using the camera, we're at home, we're stable right now, we're buying it a week later to write the evaluation."

Good match for tapo C310.

"The memory card is so good that it's not forgotten, the reading rate is stable. See the hd movie"
"The memory card is as generous as a sustainable ad or not, but wait till you find out."

"Happy with the quality of the product and the care of the customers, the long-term support, thank you, shop and tiki"
"Sure, light, easy to use, fastship"
"Light, easy to move, connections aren't so sure."
"Pretty hard, the product doesn't look like an illustration."
I'm not sure yet. It's a little short.
"Two days ago, a two-day trip to tiki. No bgio disappointed in this. I mean, it's okay."
"We've looked very closely at the order, and what we got from Vietnam -- some of it's going to be Chinese, but somewhere else -- it's good."
"The product has the right quality of the description, the package is solid, it's valuable, it's quick delivery."
"This one I've been using for almost three years, and it's been broken in my ear, and it's got a new one, but it's kind of like an old earpiece."
"The ear is clear, it's tight, but the cloth bag is thin, so it's hard to tear."
"Packing the product for sure, while receiving the product for relatively long periods of time, the product is similar to the model, the earpiece is very smooth, the sound is good, clear, smooth, generally very smooth."
"Buy it for me, so I don't know what the quality of the five* package with the visual delivery guy is just an illustration."
"The delivery is fast, even though it's near New Year's Eve, Tiki Trading's goods are good enough."
"It's nice, it's good, it's fast, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's fast, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's fast, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's fast, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's fast, it's fast delivery, it's fast delivery, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's fast stuff, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's fast, it's fast, it's good, it's fast, it's fast, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's fast, it's good, it's good, it's fast, it's fast delivery, it's good, it's fast, it's fast, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's fast, it's fast, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it"
"Sony's product should rest assured of quality, quick delivery, full stamps, but the wire is a little thin and no mic."
I got it. I got it. I got it.
"I used to have this black stuff that I bought in the back of a year, and it broke up, so now it's on tiki, it's okay, it's good, it's good for me, it's good for me, it's good for me, it's good for me, it's good for me, it's good for music, it's good for me, it's good for me, it's good for me, it's good for me, it's good for me, it's good for me."
Good delivery is like a five-star photo.
"I'm using TikiNow so super fast, but the quality of my hearing isn't what I expected."
"I don't know what it's like, but it's on time."
"This kind of earpiece is really good. I've been using it for about three years, mostly because of a screw up, and I've never seen an ear or any other disease before."
"Fast delivery, friendly shipper, and Sony's product can be reassuring, and it's pretty clear that the earpiece has a sound sound sound sound set with a sound player with Bass, and at this rate the quality is good."
"The earpiece's good, sounds good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good."
"My hearing is cheap, so I don't expect anything from the quality of sound."
"I bought this first year 2020, now I'm gonna buy this new one, it's gonna be delicious, it's gonna be cheap."
"The company's main product, the delivery is fast, TIKi is good support, very passionate, and effective."
"The quality of sound is good within range, the goods have boxes and stamps, so rest assured, Tiki delivers warp speed, 5 stars"
"Super fast delivery, the first time I've ever bought tiki, I've seen a package full of sudden ears, which is fine compared to the price, I hope it lasts a long time."
"It sounds good, it's a little thin."
"It's been good for almost two years, and even though it's been hard to get the plastic out of your head, it's still good to put it in, it's also boring, it's also good to watch a lot of headphone clips that actually are much more fun listening to a computer or a phone."
"There's no microphones, but it's right because I'm just using sound, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good."
The brand-new brand-new brand will continue to buy at this shop. Nice nvgh for all five stars.
"Sounds like a description, just like the one we bought at ***200k."
"It's a good sound, inside, it's a good fit for the price I've spent, and the wire's pretty thick, and it's just a little tight, but it's a little small, but it's okay to buy an ear wrap, which is exactly the same thing as the description."
"The packaged product is solid, the headsets have a sound box and no phone buttons, volume."
"In harmony with the need, Tiki Trading’s belongings are already prestigious, and they are quite pleased."
"The company's main product, full guidance and certificates, the manufacturer's container of products; it's a relatively good sound quality."
"Good use, guys, but you've got a mic on your ear. It's very uncomfortable."
"The first one I bought was three weeks, so I bought a second one, and I bought a little bit of a thin wire, so I bought some extra wire, and the sound was pretty good for me, and the first one I bought was three weeks, so I had to buy a second one, and I had to buy my headset less than four thousand dollars a month ago, and I had to go for four months, and I had to go for the rest of the warranty, but this girl had to be eight to nine months and never had to do it."
"Good, but sound balance isn't right for two ears, has to be adjusted in the machine, fast delivery, packaged carefully, temporarily OK."
"Prices are cheap, but quality is okay."
"The hearing earphones actually responded quite well and settled in the need to listen to their popular music, Pop/Dance/Balley, and watch movies, watching YouTube, so they don't expect too much in bass or soundproof, but if they're in their own room and they want to hear for hours without ear pain, it's okay."
It's good. I love it. It's good.

"Good use, everyone. Sound's good compared to this price."

"Quality fine,ship good"
"The earpiece is quite sound quality, the head is small, the color looks kind of light and elegant, and for me the only point is that my earpiece is too long, and I don't care if I'm stuck with something that's going to cut the wire, and for this price of Sony's, you're going to be able to buy it."
"Good price, Tiki delivers fast!"
"It's nice, it's good."
That's great.
I don't like it very much. I can't talk.

It's a good product.
"It's a fair price, but it's a little small."
"The wire's a little thin, so if you're going to buy this sp, you should consider buying more wire."
The product's good.
"After a while of using a product that's quite sustainable, a beautiful model, (I like the pink color of the product), like in the picture, the wire is a little thin, but I'm wearing a lot of outside plastic, which is very sustainable, because I don't count very carefully); it doesn't sound like ear pain; it's generally good for the product."
Very pleased with the products and services provided by Tiki
"I can hear it, but it's not good, tiki delivers it quickly."
"The delivery is quick, the earpiece is still sealed, it's worth it."

"This hearing is very good use, the sound is vivid, right Sony!! The price is reasonable, it fits my money, so here's the plus point for sp. The point is that when I buy, the next delivery is wrong, but the tikiceare service is very good, which leads me to a fairly detailed exchange, so this point might be ignored, in general, I like this sp."

"The sound of honesty, which is almost as much as the earpiece of the Ottawa 6s/plus, can be a little loud to you as it is to you who has small ears, while you're staying still or walking, doesn't fail."
It's very good. It's very short.
It's beautiful. It's nice.
Okay.

"I've been using my ears for a long time, but I've been using my ears for good, clear, beautiful blue, sometimes loose, without sound, and cutting off my ears as if they were in ear."
The earlobe has a very good earbump.
I don't know.
It's not as high as 200 but it's not as good as Sony's.
Satisfaction
"Okay, listen, product looks like something."
"I don't know how long, I don't know."
"I've been waiting for the sale of goods to come back, so I've got a very small, convenient, very young, very young, very active earpiece, so when I hear some very good music, Sony, which is a very popular brand, it's worth a lot of money for this product."
"Good, clear, little bass."
"I bought this piece of headphones because I broke the earphone's earphone, and whoever wanted a non-automatic ear that wasn't too generous, this girl was well-off, the sound was clear, the volume was bigger than the other earpiece, including using a laptop."
The earpiece is perfect.
"The good product, the right color, the warranty, the clear home."
"Spang, nice, tiki delivers super fast"
"10 out of 10 points at the price range, even though the wrong color delivery is set, which is good, so it's still 550,000."
Okay.
We'll make the delivery tomorrow morning.
"The ear is good, the sound is loud, the sound is good, the noise's good, the price's right, should be bought."
"It sounds like a lot of people, I'll try one more for you guys."
It's a product that's satisfying.
The sound is quite loud compared to the earphone.
g
Listeny okay fits the price.
"It's good, it's cheap."
Good.
The price of 180k makes sense. It sounds good at this price range.
Fine quality
"Good headsets, young colors, good sound levels, good for the price."
It's okay. It's okay.
Sounds good.
"I bought this black product that I've been using for a few weeks; this simple code, this earpiece, I love it because it doesn't fall out of my ear and it hurts like a round head now, a company or a producer, sounds less bass, but it's still very alive."
"As soon as I saw on Tiki, there was Sony's earpiece, I immediately ordered it to hold one. For his earpiece, Sony was probably the leading brand used by quite a lot of people, and so on."
"We use more than two months and we have some comments like this: -- ears that are relatively nice, bass's fine, especially with beautiful love songs -- not a lot of pain -- once in a while it's been in the water, but put it in a box of rice, the next day it still sounds good."

"I've received a package after a day's installation, a very good product quality, a sound content, a sound increase, a thin wire, but just wrap it up is fine, the product is packed carefully, and I'm very satisfied with Tiki's work quality."
"Okay, well, it's within range."
"It's good music, bass is better than any other company."
"(Laughter) (Applause) Thank Tiki for packing so carefully, her little earpiece, and her big box.)"
Good.
"All right, headset's on. Okay."
Nice bass earpiece.
"It sounds very loud, consistent with price."
The product fits the price.
I've been on it for two years.
The product that uses OK fits the price.
Good.
"Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes."
"Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes."
"The product was good, I bought it and I spent it for about two weeks, there was no problem, good sound, there was also underwear."
"It's cheap, it's good."
"It's good stuff, man. It's good stuff. It's good stuff."
"Sony's brand is a big brand, so I'm relieved, I've been good for two months."
"It's easy, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good."
"Rows exactly as described, sounds are heard at"
"The product is extremely sustainable, even though you've been throwing it around a lot, it's still the same as it was when you bought it for months and years."
Good.
That's great.
Quick delivery.
good use
The headset's fine compared to the price.
Okay.
"Good, tough."
"The earpiece was used for four months because of not being careful, so he couldn't hear one side of it, but after he got to sony's maintenance center, he was transformed."
"At this price, it's fine. Sound's fine."
It's good at the price -)
Fine.
"The sound isn't as vivid as the neieiser we're using, but compared to the price and quality of the two, Sony Fonosher MDR-E9LPTai is fine."
"The product's fine, I love it."
The product sounds fine at the price of money.
That's great.
That's good.
"Nice paper attached, sure packed warranty."
"I bought this white earpiece, which is beautiful. It doesn't sound shy or anything."
"That's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good."
It's awesome. It's awesome. It's awesome.
"Good earpieces match the price, sound pretty good, spend a few months still sound good."
"The medical product, good use, long rope."
"I've been buying myrrh for a week. It sounds good. Long rope, very nice blue."
It's been a while since I've had an earache.
"Beautiful, sound good, quick delivery, carefully packed"
"It's good, it's been years. It's not bad."
"It's okay, I don't like hearing ears, I don't like tables, I get little mattresses that tickles my ears, don't cause pain when I'm on my side listening to music."
s
"Small hearing, nice box, good use compared to the price."
"Quick delivery and package, 5 stars for Tiki."
"It's cheap, but it sounds good, it's like some other selling wire, it's clear, it's flat, it's kind of eary, it's cute, it's full of colors."
It's worth it.
"Giam mem, fart tot, clear across the ball of sour valves"
Okay.
"The ear is open, the sound is loud and alive, the quality and security is much safer than the earpieces selling the tea on the street."
Good.
"When he bought this, his friend loved it, he said he'd buy it for him, and with this price, all the sounds of life were fully transmitted."
"Listen to the music, it's because there's a pad, and the mic's too tight."
"The company's main product, beautiful model, quality sounds good."
"I bought it almost five years ago, but it's a long way to go."
Sony's ear is very good.
"I like it. I wear it a little loose, but it's okay, tiki delivers it fast before we even plan to make it a day."
"Chat often am tot, ben and listen."
"The hearing is great, it's great, it's good, it's good. I just bought it now, so there's nothing wrong with it."
"Main, soft to the detail, good quality product at the price."
Tiki delivers fast and carefully.
"It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay?"
"The earphone is carefully packed and nice, delivered quickly, very pleased."
Quick delivery. The sound sounds good at this price.
"Loud, well-known Tiki delivers on time, a careful and beautiful package box."
"It's good, it's good to hear, it's good to have mics."
"Fast delivery, carefully packed, hearing ears on both sides, at no time."
"Headset's pretty good for the price, Sony's brand."
"Nice color, when it doesn't sound like it's falling off."
I don't need to talk about it.
"It's okay if you listen to music, but you don't have a pass or a bamboo, and you're sitting on it, and you're moving a little bit, and you're falling out of your ear, and you don't pay for it, so you're thinking about it before you buy it."
It's been a while since I bought Tiki's.
"I ordered a daily order of August 26, 2020 and 27th, August 2020, and the product was told that one year's worth of product, but the drop ticket was 17/19th."
Good.
"Sony's product makes me very trusted in quality -- beautiful ear, I'm used for iPads and I'm very OK -- there's an ear mattress, so it's very smooth."
"I love this stuff, and first of all, it's pretty good, for a non-professional person who just listens to taste music, and it's too good, and the other thing I like is that my head is pretty good, and I don't hurt as long as I've worn it, but the biggest weakness of this kind is a pretty thin piece of rope, and if you don't hold it right, I'm pretty easy to think, anyway, I'm going to give you four or five points."
"It's almost like this price, before you buy it, you can't get it, you can't stop, you can get it, you can get it, you can't hear it, you can't hear it, you can't hear it, you can't hear it, you can't even hear it, you can't even hear it."
"This ear is open and it's hard to fall, it's long and it's useless, it's so twisted together, it's heavier than earphones, it's a lot on the table when it pulls its ear to the floor, it's buying the xiami at the same price that's out."
"I just got the shipment, I can hear the ear, I was wondering if I had two ears, but I opened the line and I only saw a pew of ear."
"It's three-tenths of an earphone, but it's worth four stars."
"Sound sounds good, earpieces small, fast transport, price good."
"The exact sound of the Vietnamese Sony (made in Vietnam) wore soft (smoking), OK form. However, when I use direct plugs on the Earth, I hear loud and small sounds and in low-size), and the volume on the computer (through long wires) is only 70 percent, even though it has been modified by the volum PC Max and it doesn't sound good, I try to plug the audio hole directly on the PC, and the PC on the table cannot be used that way."
"The last thing we bought in Tiki Trading had bills, but the last few times, we didn't have bills, we didn't have to pay the bills, so we don't have to buy them as much as we used to."
"I'm disappointed by the sound quality of my headphones, although it's Sony, stamps, full flow, sounds, it's very boring."
"The sound quality only responds to English. Listens to music because there's no bass and there's no sound that's long enough to hurt, it's quite disappointed with the product at this price range, and the product is able to change when it's not an error, but in the condition that it hasn't been opened, because it's not appropriate for the user to open and feel the quality needs to change."
"I don't have a microphone, I don't have a sound correction button."
"I don't think it's the only way to get rid of the order in eight days, but I don't think it's the best way to sell the product."
"Nice package, nice sound, but the delivery's a little slow due to COVID."
"The quality of sound is very boring, it's small, it's very timid for the big volume to be right, but even though Sony's standards are full, the quality of sound is really much worse than the ear that comes with the machine."
"Listen, one side of you can't hear me, you can't hear me on the other side, you can't talk to me about your connections."
Not from Sony's own store.
I've been able to choose Sony since I bought (28/10) for over a month now.
"I've just received a bug on one side of the hearing, so please trade it for another."
"It's extremely normal to be deaf. Without mics, tiki delivers as quickly as possible."
"The bass and bamboo sound is no good, it's no good for regular pop music, anyone who's interested in rock or EDD should not buy it."
"The thin wire, the sound of the loudspeaker, is a bit disappointed, even though it says Chinese Sony!"
"Get the right color -- listen to the music -- okay, but when I talk to you, the recording's on the end of the head, and I'm going to have to put on one ear, and I'm going to have to talk to the other, and then I'm going to listen to this, and I'm going to say it's not okay."
"The store doesn't write down the information so I buy it, I plug it into the computer, I can't hear it, can I support it through the other earphones?"
"The appearance is good, the quality of the product hasn't been tested yet. It's temporary for four stars. Thank you, tiki."
The tiki team handles the problem like lame pants.
"OK, nice package."
"I'd like to trade goods, tiki happy, very weak ears with wires that cost only 1.50."
Thin Wire
"Bad quality, breaking ears, low quality of ears, low quality of hearing."
"I mean, it's kind of like this type of microphone integrating, and it's called in, but the other side can't hear me, and there's no mic on the other side."
Ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok
"The sound quality of the headset is very boring: small volume, you can't hear the bass."
"The sound is not warm and as good as expected, delivered quickly, the product itself is lipstick."
"It sounds like mono, it's very painful whether you're wearing a pair of tweezers or not, for a few minutes or so, to feel uncomfortable even though you're adjusting the volume."
"I don't know why one earpiece is smaller than another, but if you buy it, you'll consider it."
"Fast delivery, well-packed, beautiful color, low-eared, sound quality, people with small ears or antlers on the outside, they're all right, they're just a little bit small and thin, they're short!"
"Listen, microphones talking, too bad, when you buy, you don't notice."
"I've been buying this pink earpiece for three years, and I've been running around, and sometimes I've got blood rain on my ears."
"Sound good, no ear pain"
"Before you buy yourself a product you don't read in advance, the sad point of the rope is that you don't support mics, you have to take your headset off."
"You're hearing it. 100K is temporary, lower than average."
A broken ear can't hear me. I'm too lazy to judge.
"I'm really disappointed about this product, it's not worth the money and the quality is not as good as advertising, the normal material, the hard-wired material, the bass is bad, it sounds like monochrome, it's small, it's not as big as it looks, it's even worse than my sister's GHS, it's only 80,000, it's cheaper."
"When the satles are 99k, the general review: earlaces that are old, which aren't confused, which is fine, which is the long-term experience, and the plus is that there are two spongy membranes that wrap their ears, which are smoother on their ears."
"The earpiece is not sound quality, the left ear has a much smaller volume than the right one that causes discomfort."
mid
"Good delivery, good sound. Okay."
"Pack your ears up, your ears are smaller than your ears, so you can't hear the bass sound."
"That sounds like a break, because that's the price."
"This Sony earpiece has a clear sound, a good ear, no sharp hand, no close ear and no hard-on hearing, very smooth and also not easy to fall; the right ear length, no lasting support; the cost of the city on Tiki is too good for quality, and it has many youthful colors to choose from."
"The earphone only works one side, needs to be traded."
"The sound's okay, the wire's too thin, the ability to break, it's not sustainable."
"Good quality, quick delivery."
"I can't even close my ears, I can't tear it."
"Old ears, dirty, white ones, dirty yellow. The left earpiece can't hear."
"The quality is fine, at this price rate too ok----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------"
"It's June 2020, so let's say it's not warranty."
"I can only hear one ear. I'm tired of returning the goods, waiting to deliver them, and I don't know when I'll get one, tiki delivers the goods."
The bass is pretty weak. It sounds like a couple of dozen shorts outside the store.
"Two weeks later, no one's come to pick up the goods, no one's going to pick it up."
"It's quite stable. It's less vulnerable to collision, but it's limited to impact."
"I'd like to change the product, okay? Well, I've always bought goods from tiki since I've had an error, so I'm hoping for an answer from the shop."
"It's hard to wear in the ear, the sound's fine."
"There's no microphone, there's no bth."
"Pretty expensive, no microphone to say."
"The product's got mic problems, I'm talking through earphones, and the other side's not listening."
No quality hearing hand. It's been a month.
How did you hear that? There's one ear.
I can't hear you cut the wire with your hands on it.
"Quick delivery, packaged goods."
Pretty pleased with the price and quality of this sp.
Can't hear me when I put it in my laptop.
"It's really disappointing that Sony's audio quality is so bad, it's worse than 50K worth of earpieces being sold online."
"At my hearing I only heard one side, I wanted to change the shop."
"The sound's tearing, less bass, the movie's not appropriate for listening to music."
Use it steady.
"The negative's a little bad, but at this price, it'll work."
Sound's not that good.
It's not even a month ago. One of my ears is broken.
"For a time there was a terrible earache, and there was no mic."
It's like hearing 20k.
The hearing is only good within the price range because it's relatively cheap and gives the sound small compared to the other earpieces that you're using.
Hello. <i>I'm sorry.</i> <i>I'm sorry.</i> <i>I'm sorry.</i> <i>I'm sorry.</i> <i>I'm so sorry.</i> <i>I'm so sorry.</i> <i>I'm so sorry.</i> <i>I'm so sorry.</i> <i>I'm so sorry.</i>
Good.
I don't know how to use it. It's a good deal.
"The error product only hears one ear, pays off."
"The last time I put this product in white, it was soft, it was pretty good, and then I forgot, so I bought it in the same place as the black sp, but it sounded pretty good and it was a long time ago."
"The hearing ear is used for learning English, for listening to music is acceptable at the cost of this city, and I've bought it for a long time, and I don't see any trouble, and I don't know what's wrong with my underwear being dirty, and I take off my contact with my ears a little hard, and I'm not used to having ear pain at first."
"Quick delivery, small earpieces, no hugs and no load."
"The product's pretty good, the package's tight, but the product doesn't have a call button on it, it's kind of uncomfortable to drive."
That's a fair quality compared to the price.
"Sony has always been known for its well-sounded tech products, and Sony Fonco's earpiece, which he bought because he lost an earpiece of Sony's phone, because he saw that the white was young and the price was fine and he bought it."
"Fast delivery, well packed, it's kind of boring, but it's true, because it's cheap, it's not a high price."
"Does it keep slipping, with a loud sound coming out? I don't know, but it's going to sound good?"
"Hong, buy the wrong shit."
"Sweet but thin, bass + treb is as good as no. The details are also temporary compared to earbud 500k. This ear is used to listen to the soft pop like min st319, which is fine. And the same price you can try to get across the monk pluss is very high, but it's still just an earbud 200k, so don't get your hopes up."
"The sound is generally quite good, pure and clean, each part of the bass sounds a little bit weak."
Sounds good.
"The earpieces are good, but they're distorted for four stars."
"Buying on May 10, 2020, today is June 2006, 2021 (that is, about a year), deaf on either side:"
"It's okay, it's a bit of a pain in the ear."
Why can't I tell you something? Just listen.
"The earpiece is nice, but without a microphone, the quality of hearing is loud."
"Sound's okay, no microphones, it's uncomfortable."
It's good to use it temporarily.
The product is really bad. The other side is broken.
"There's no audio drop button, so it's kind of awkward."
I got off the phone at first but I got off the phone with a voice on one side of the phone.
"The earpiece is short, but since there's no ear button, it's pretty much acoustic."
"We buy pink, we listen to good music, the rope lasts a long time, and there's no sign of a broken wire like the usual kind of thing, the only thing that's not very good at hearing, if you're wearing it in noise, is you don't really hear the music very well."
"It's fine compared to price, quick delivery."
"The quality of sound is temporary, but if you're buying to listen to music, it's not okay, because you need a cable that doesn't have a mic to buy it."
"I can't hear one side of the ear, how can I contact Tiki in exchange for the product?"
"My left earpiece is quite timid, and I thank you for the return of the product."
"Anyone who wants to use their headsets to listen to music is best not to buy it, it's just good enough to hear your voice."
"But the sound is quite small, but maybe it's part of the machine, and the ear button doesn't have a button, so if you buy it, you think about it before you make a decision."
"You don't have mics on your ears, you learn online."
"The company's main product, which is pretty good compared to the cost of earset Sony Fonzie MR-E9LP."
It's okay. It's a little thin.
"I'm not good, but I'm all for tiki."
"There's no increase in volume or microphones, so it might be a little uncomfortable."
I hear a lot of pouts. I hear a lot of songs.
"The sound doesn't sound great, but I can't ask for more than that."
"Okay, well, within range, there's not much bass."
"Listen. Okay, the box's pretty good, and each one's a little disappointed because the ear doesn't have a mic."
No mic.
"All right, let's go. Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go!"
The package hasn't arrived until it's delivered successfully.
"Tiki makes a quick delivery, but when people arrive at a new location, they make the user a little bit more passive in the job, which the rather friendly employee should be able to ignore, and the product, on the box, has dust on it. (Laughter) Good hearing, reasonable in the amount of money, hopefully can last a long time."
"It's not good for you to hear it, it's bad for you to hear it, but it's good for the price."
Accepted at a price range.
It's like shit.
Synchronising folder
"The old stuff's broken in one ear, but it's broken the bill and then it can't be changed."
"No mic's a little uncomfortable, but okay."
Good.
What's wrong with yours?
"Good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good."
"Listen to music. Okay, but without the mic, what's going on, when you're buying, what's going on?"
The ear is too bad. It's not good.
"Good earsets, better than good price."
"Lucky not made in china, made in vietnam all the way"
No audio mics. Good sound quality.
Okay.
The earpiece is pretty good for cheap.
The wire's a little thin.
Sound sounds like a standard Chinese speaker and no microphone.
The ice cream chat.
"The earpiece is so long that the sound is comfortable, the sound is right, it doesn't always have earache, but the mouth is attached to the earpiece and there's no substitute for it."
"The hearing's new, but it's only heard from one side."
Fine.
"I've only bought 25/50 ears, and I've lost one side, and I've kept it in my pocket."
"I was very disappointed when I got the product because the new one opened the box that broke in one earphone, and I put it into another phone, and on the computer, and it broke in the earphone, and the price was a little bit expensive compared to some of the other listening lines, but since it's sony's earpiece, I picked it, and I was really disappointed when I received it."
temporary
"There's no microphone, there's no sound, there's a sound, there's a sound."
You can use it. It's better if you buy Xiaoomi HSEJ03JY.
Okay.
"But with this price the product is quite fine, it's neat, it's nice, it's good to go, it's loud, it's good to listen to popular music."
"I've been getting the goods a little bit longer than the last ones, but I don't think it's a good idea to try it on iphone because I'm afraid it'll spoil the hearing ear twice because of the other ears that don't work out."
"It's exciting, it's hopeful, but it's not as good as it sounds, but it doesn't sound good."
The product for negative quality isn't really good.
"I've only been getting the supplies for a few days, I've only got one side, I'm so disappointed."
"If only there were more microphones to talk, it would be nice to increase the volume."
"The quality of hearing, which is appropriate for normal listening, doesn't require embellishment, this price is not high."
The sound quality is less than this price.
"Beautiful product, sound quality is fine."
The head plugs into the phone sometimes it's a little hard to untangle and spin again and again to match the sound in the head of the head.
"Well, it's kind of light-squeezy, but bass is too weak. It's not good music, compared to this amount of money, it's less than a lot of earpieces and a lot of other prices."
It sounds pretty good at this price range.
"The sound quality of the headset, it's no big deal, but at this level, you can't ask for more."
"Easy to fall, low sound quality ybz 40k"
"Listen to the music, you shouldn't have bought this."
The year sx 205 expires with the warranty.
Okay.
The sound is wonderful compared to the price.
"It's easy to lose, no mics."
"Sounds pretty good for the price range, but there's no tuner button in the ear, so it's kind of uncomfortable to want to increase the square sound, to cut the wire, and it's a little thin, and it's a little dirty."
"And it's actually pretty good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good for students' English lessons, it's good for them, it's good for them, it's good for them, it's good for them, it's cheap, it's cheap, it's just bad for the cards, it's good for screaming machines, it's good for good stuff, but it's slow delivery."
"Big headsets, big ears, big ears, big ears, big ears, big ears, big ears, big ears, big ears, big ears, big ears, big ears, big ears, big ears, big ears, big ears, big ears, big ears, big ears, big ears, big ears, big ears, big ears, big ears, big ears, big ears, big ears, big ears, big ears, big ears."
"I can use the time when my hearing ears are great, the sound is vivid, and I can listen to the writer very clearly, but the only thing is that there's no switch as much as I like, great color, listening to the time that's still great, and hopefully there's going to be so many good products."
"The product has a relatively good quality and has a reasonable price: loud sound, obviously consistent with the needs of most people; it's also cheap, so it doesn't have a microphone or an volumination button; it's easy to buy this product on tiki, and it's safe in quality, but it doesn't have an ear color that should be a little bit disappointed."
Okay.
Tiki delivers on the exact day of the product at no time. not good.
"It sounds so warm, so different from the tambud's earbuds on the j7 machine, it's kind of rounded, bass's fine, bamboo sharp but small but sounds extremely detailed"
"I've bought and I've tried my Sony fonjeweb E9LP. Sony's work has always made sure that the quality, the beautiful color, is good for the teenager, and there's a lot of color to choose."
"It's okay to listen to Tootsie music, but if it's 100 percent bass, this one's only 20 percent."
Sounds good.
"It's okay. It's not so good, but it's not a lift. It's a lot of ear pain."
"My friends are always complaining that the microphone's a little small, so my voice's voice's not good."
"Get rid of the MH410c Sony, it's 170k, but there's more phone and pros."
Quality at price range...
"Headsets don't have mics, thin wires."
"The quality of sound like a punch in the ear, which was not expected at first."
"The phone sounds good. Okay, but it's a bit of a price."
"I've ordered a week and I've paid for it, but the procedure is just getting the order."
I haven't bought one month already.
"Let's see how cheap Sony looks, but it's not cool."
"The sound's all right, but the wire's too small and thin, and we don't know how strong..."
"The earpiece is very carefully packed and it looks very luxurious; the outside is very cute; yet the wire is a little short, the sound quality is good compared to the price, it's a year's ejaculation, it's very reassuring, it suits students like you, hihi!"
"In general, Sony's earpiece is pretty soft, and I'm pretty good with sound quality, and it's pretty cool, and it's limited to other headsets, and there's no microphones, and there's no music button, so it's kind of awkward to call."
"A little scratch on the shell, but it's fine."
"The good product, which fits the price, the colors are beautiful."
"At the right price and Sony brand, I'm more secure in quality, and I'd like to meet my request for music, and if Tiki's more colorful, it's good, but the pink with girls like me is quite fashionable, and I'd prefer Tiki to deliver quickly, and I'd wrap the goods, and I'd label it as ""a fragile"" on the outside."
"I like to listen to loud music, and the person sitting next to me can hear it, compared to his earpiece, is not far from the sound."
I can't believe it if you listen to music with your headset!
That's not a good sound.
"Good earphones, there's also a pad with them, so you can put them in there to help with the ear pain if you listen for a long time; the price is good compared to the quality, but I think you should use your black headphones if you want the wire to stay unspotted:) Tiki delivers them carefully."
It's not what it's supposed to be.
The product's pretty OK.
"Since speaker doesn't have mics, it's only for laptops, and with electricity, it only listens to one side (because Jack's feet are not of the same type)."
good product
The product doesn't have a conversation mic.
What money is it?
"Now, too many kinds of headsets on the market, but actually Sony's product is very standing, and the point that makes the value of the dignity is very good compared to the quality that the quality of the quality of the quality of the quality of the young eye and the quality of the sound that is vivid, especially appropriate for listening to music is the advantage of this product."
temporary
"It's the right row, and it's on the picture."
"At a price like this, it's hard to sound as good as a few million earpieces, but for a high school listener, or to listen to an ielts like me, it's good, it's cheap, it's very good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good."
"Tiki delivers very quickly, only two days after putting it, and she's got the good stuff, and she likes the tiki way of doing it, and the earpiece is nice and light, but the earlaces are a little thin, the sound quality at an acceptable level, just enough to hear the sound, and the accompanying gift is a beautiful box of hearing, depending on the color that you choose for your hearing."
Fine.
Bad ear. It's very loud.
The wire is very soft.
It's good. It's nice. It's packed.
"I bought these headsets because I didn't like the kind of earpieces that are so popular; Sony was always the best choice; the standard sound, the price was too good; the design caught an eye, but even though it's 1 meter long, it's still the length of most hearing ears, so there's nothing special about it."
Okay.
"Tiki delivers fast, including warranty, sound quality is fine, clear, small and thin, easily confused."
Tiki delivers on time and product guarantees quality
"It sounds clear, it doesn't break."
"Sound clear, inside, I'm very pleased."
It's not good.
"It's hard to put in your ear, your hard piece of plastic, your ears, your sounds, it's not good enough, it's cheap."
quick delivery
"Advantage: The bass ear is very good, tiki packs well, delivers quickly: earphones don't have a mic, warrants press into the little box that wrinkles"
Please.
Satisfaction
"The other wire is long and thin, and for a while there's a filter inside of an earpiece."
Dong calls bi dep kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk
I don't know how long it's going to last because I haven't been using it for long.
"I can hear you, but there's no recording button, so the computer's a little unpredictable."
"- Ears don't go easy on the ear, it feels a little painful."
"Good quality, consistent with people who have wet ears like themselves (if they have rubber in their ears that's very uncomfortable)"
- The long but thin string - The minus bass is weak but the quality corresponds to the price - the good warranty - the square plug does not fear to be cut in
"At this price, it's not a good sound, it's a bad idea, it's not a waste of money if you want a good sound, it's more expensive."
"I've spent almost five months breaking one side of the wire in my ear, and I haven't been very careful."
I've bought a month and I'm happy with this product.
It's been a long time since I've seen the bass.
"I bought it for a few weeks, and I put it this way. It's like a bad chat."
I've got a lot of earpieces. I've got a loud earpiece. I've got a ring on my earpiece.
"At this price, the headset is more stable than the other earpieces we've ever used."
"The sound's pretty good, but it's not a microphone support, so it's not very good."
Sounds like a few tens of thousands of earpieces on the market.
"So cheap, it's not much but it's not sure, the ear is cracked during the use."
"The hearing is not high-end, so I don't judge bass, the key to normal people's needs, the ear's loud."
"Use ok at the price range, buy more products from Sony."
"If you buy it for a couple of months, it's okay to use it for 200 averages, that's all right."
"Wire is a little thin, quality isn't too good, it's not so smooth, but it's generally pretty good for price."
"The hearing's fine, the volume's clear, but it's very painful."
"Sound sounds good, but the wire's a little thin, just afraid of being cut when you're stretched when you forget to remove your headset."
"Poor sound quality, easily broken string quality, no volume adjustment node"
"Perfected, bass sounds good at the price range, packed carefully, delivered fast."
"Jack's plug is loose, he's got to put paper tight, sound's good at a price worth buying."
Everything's fine except bass. I don't know if it's my machine or my headset.
"It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay."
"The hearing ear, only I didn't agree to be a pretty piece of wire."
"Good, good, good, good, good, good, good."
"The ear is so sweet, so free is the ear's ear."
"Good product, quality sound, quick delivery."
"There's no button to change songs or mics, just headsets, no earpieces, three lines, not four lines."
"I bought this product with a 50% discount of my tiki, which is packed well, careful, beautiful box, lovely pink ear, suitable for girls, I've spent almost two years, but I've been very good at it, and I don't have earlobes, but I can get dirty in my ear pads, and I can tell you what's good for a student's money."
"It's a good sign that when you buy it, you don't have to worry about the quality of the product of the purchase."
"Sony is one of the most famous firms for good products, and this is one of the things that proves that there's a good design, there's a lot of color to choose, there's a good sound, there's a good price, there's a good price, there's a long rope."
"The earpiece is pretty good, the sound is clear and smooth, unfortunately without the switch and the volume switch on the wire, and I find quite a favorite of this product, and my friend likes it, and he's waiting for more goods to come in, and too long to see that tiki's got the goods back."
"The plastic fit, the plastic is solid, in accordance with the need."
"It's beautiful, and it's really tight, and it's holding it tight, and it's in its arms, and it's in its arms, and it's in its arms, and it's in its body, especially the shock and the part of the camera and the screen that's great, because it's going to be the best protection for the body."
"Nice, tight fit, for a year to go by, light gold, you'll put a black edge on it to help with the gold."
"It's nice, it's sure, it fits right into the machine."
"It's nice, it's on, it's on, it's on, it's on, it's on, it's on, it's on, it's on, it's on, it's on, it's on, it's on, it's on, it's on, it's on, it's on, it's on, it's on."
Black op is too black for the black machine. OK.
"Nice, satisfied, but it takes time to assess how fast the calories will be, the price is a bit high, the quality comes with the quality."
"It's beautiful, it's not too thick or thin, it's steady, it's classy."
I think it's nice.
"Nice, firm, and tight."
"It's nice, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good."

It's beautiful. It's important to protect cameras and screens.
"It's like beautiful information, it's tight to the machine, it's nice to see color, it's good to see, it's good to see."
It's beautiful.
"The Shop is very supportive, even though my mistake is wrong, for the 5-star shop."
"It's a nice back, it's built, it's solid, it's time to check it out."
"It's like holding a machine, and it's like it's not really good. It's really good."

"It's good quality, it's pretty good at first."
"I can't believe the product's so boring, I'd love to check it out."
Oedable but does not fit my 12 prox
"The quality is temporary, but the price is more likely to be reevaluated."
It's a little hard.
It's normal for a price.
It's still too fast to stain.
Not as pretty as advertising.
It's nice and tight.
Satisfaction
It's beautiful. It's not very flexible.

Please choose the beautiful number that doesn't work as well as the net product.
"Quick delivery, carefully packed."
Slow Network
Back in the day of screaming the Internet.
"It's a six-month package, but the fact that 5 months is out of the network, it's not cheap, it's a very poor wave, it's impossible to compare with the big networks."
The network settles the price in general OK

"It's small, it's convenient."
"It's solid, it's solid, it's solid, it's super solid, everybody, it's really cool to pick up the stuff."
"Ship super speed, new product as beautiful as the picture. Note: when you flip the ON switch, the lights don't appear to be like other mice, so it's easy to think that the mouse is bad."
"Mouse uses an AA battery, which is accompanied by a battery which also takes a signal to insert into the computer. Mouse has an open button. Mouse middle button can press easily. Medium mouse weight, easy movement, accurate roll on a wooden side with no mouse pads still feels the correct response."
"The product has the right quality of the description, the package is solid, it's valuable, it's quick delivery."
"The last time I went to tiki and bought the M221, which is OK, but unfortunately, it's not working, so I'm still going up to tiki, and I'm still putting this version because I'm afraid I'm going to use it again because I'm interested in its design, and it's cute, and Tiki's always delivering before the time, packing it's a nice design box, and it's heavier than the M221 version, which has a battery in it, and there's not much to talk about it, so I know a lot of the technology, and that's a lot of it's a lot of it's enough."
"With the demand for an office, this mouse responds very well, I've used a mouse that's had a wire that's been running for eight years, and this B175 is a little bit small, if you use it for a laptop, and if you're fixed, people should buy a bigger one with a stronger hand feel."
"Rats are still right in Logotech, but the weight's a little light, but it's still extremely comfortable. It's a pretty good battery."
"SN on the box and on the mouse doesn't match. If you sell the blue box, you're looking for the real thing."
"I've set the tiki now, so it's only an hour before I've delivered it."
"Five stars for tiki, no problem trying a mouse because the same old one you used to buy should always be comfortable with."
"The product's described, the delivery's on schedule."

The mouse is very smooth.
"Mouse use oke, smooth, sensitive"

"Okay, good use. It takes more time to confirm, five stars."
"The reliable Arkintech, the packaged Tiki carefully forgot to take a picture up and take a picture of his shop?"
"Fast delivery is very satisfying, the mouse is sensitive and full of batteries should be able to buy it immediately, and it's urgent, so it's very satisfying."
It's fast and it's real.
"The quick delivery of the product is ok and is sensitive, the duability is not measured because it takes time."
That's great.

It's a good quality product. It's an official distribution of tiki.
"Time travel on schedule, hope to last."
It's so beautiful. <i>The logo is new.</i> <i>You guys.</i> <i>It's not a fake.</i> <i>But it's a little loud.</i> <i>I wish it was too good.</i> <i>I heard you used it.</i>
"The company itself, new, shell data is like the hand-sharp cable, the Alcaline battery, along with well, the mouse-recognition computer as soon as it cuts its head without any manual settings, the sensitive button."
"This is the second time we've bought from a shop, so we can trust the store. It's been a long time since the mouse's been used."
Good Use
Quick delivery shop smooth mouse move

"The product used ok, now it's not for laptop use, but now it's very convenient. Small, neat, right price."

"Whether it's a feature or an error, where the light on the mouse is lit, the mouse is used normally."
"Booked daily on June 6, July 7th, received a package. Packed carefully, not used yet, so there's no accurate assessment of the mouse attached to it, so can we use it now?"

It's very smooth.

"Got the package, tiki packed very carefully, but the delivery time is a little long (it's been a week), the quality's fine."
Fine figure smooth mouse
"It's cheap, it's nice, it's small, it's good, it's good to buy."
"+ “The price is very reasonable. The quality of the companies that are hard to compare with the small shape of the battery, which is easy to grasp for a year, which is more than a hundred laser technology, which means that the mouse is quite sensitive and moving, who needs to be quick about using it -- this mouse is for smart TV or the TV box that is extremely appropriate."

"Yeah, it's the same company."
"We're gonna put the wrong wireless mouse at home, and we're gonna have a wireless radar rat, and we're gonna move automatically when no one moves in, or we're gonna play an automated game, and then we're gonna go find a mouse with a wire, and then we're gonna notice that title is a wireless mouse, and then we're gonna buy it, and then we're gonna go back."

"The mouse used quite well, the offer was 158k, so I tried it out, but I'm using the old one pretty smooth, so it's pretty smooth, and through this sample, it's kind of noisy and it's a touch, it's a quick roll, it's a two-day roll, it's a small roll, I hope after a few days there's no more noise."

"Last time I bought it, it didn't matter, the S/N number outside the box and the mouse trunks didn't match S/N. The pictures on the box were all written, the actual picture was just a GPL, and the sense that it was strange and that it had been used for years."
Okay.
"Good, quick delivery, carefully packed!"
"These B175 wireless rats are perfectly worthy of 5 so that the corresponding price of the money, you've used since January16 has not failed."
"The first time I decided to buy the wireless mouse and I picked this one, after a really good time of use, both hand and hand."

"The whole box, the whole set."
"With no tight wire available, mice are sensitive, proportional to the price of money."
"The product's been good, using six months hasn't been dead yet."
Like a supermarket that's cheaper than a fair amount.

Rats are not like the fact that the SN code on the box doesn't match the S/N code of the product.
It's a beautiful package. It's good. It's good. It's on tiki.
It's a product that's been used since June 1616.
"Packed up carefully, delivered quickly, and the Volvotech cat gets on top of the mouse with a GPG on it, and we don't know if it's the original product, but we'll see how fast and sensitive it is to use our time."
"It's new, it's good. If there's a problem, I'll yell at you."

"The product is light, it's easy to move when it's far away, it's good to use."
"Rats are sensitive, they don't have a tech, their heads are a little weak, and they're hoping to use the right delivery of tiki, but they're a week behind than they're supposed to be. In particular, GBM, they're waiting for more than two weeks."
"Packing carefully, the product uses quite a small advantage, the speed of processing is fine, it needs to be better able to buy more expensive"
The package is carefully packed.
"Number one: put the batteries right and turn them on through the ""On"" mode, but the lights don't light."
He just received an open box and the mouse is on a pop-up page where the mouse light is not lit. Try connecting to the computer does not count at all. Call the TV operator and tell the tech to check and be innovative. I'm in a hurry and I'm still not seeing any calls.
"SN outside the box is different from the SN on the product. M/N on the mouse is MR0089, checked out on the company's Excelsior found MR0024."
"It's a good product, except for a long-term delivery star."
"If the delivery fails, the battery won't turn on the light."
"[QC]Vi VNPAY SIXI100, put me in jail for 100K taxi."
"It's a little bit smaller than the used mice. Click, roll bigger than the current HP. The paster is a little weird."
"Hi Tiki, I've been using the mouse for three weeks now that I've bought 10/1022, it's suddenly not working, and I've tried to replace it to the new battery, but I still can't."
"This mouse has DPI - DPI standard used to measure mouse sensitivity, which is represented as a number (dot on a linear inch) that a device can detect - low so you'll get a clear sense of low sensitivity. It's much clearer when you use mice that have a high DPI before. For that reason, your performance will go down."
It's okay.
"Saigon's still smooth, but this one's got 2020 and it's not as good as the old ones."
"I've seen Tiki's VAT bill lately when they need VAT bills, which means they need to be used as a witness, but they're really bad."
Mouse failed to light the lights
"The store doesn't check first, the delivery doesn't see the warranty stamps... it's not happy... to get the product and see that it's not bright."
"Buying you two, you're both in a bad mood, and you're both in a bad mood, and you don't know when it's going down, and with a brand as big as Logotech, it's so disappointing, it's not as cheap as a boat mouse."
"Mouse is fine but has to buy black full mouse underwear because mice are only good black sensors, the underwear they're using is black and green should be used with shorts, have to buy black enough to use"
"The mouse's a little small for my hand, but one thing is the light's under the mouse, and I turn on the switch on and I put the battery on, and I can use it, but the light's not on the mouse."
Because I bought a mouse like that and it had a logo.
Quick delivery. Right package is fine.
"There's a battery attached to the mouse but it's got a mouse in the ON button, so it's out of the battery."
"Receiver isn't the Unifyr, so it's not going to be able to use one receiver with a keyboard, it's going to cost a USB port, it's going to take about an hour every night, but a battery lasts five or six weeks, less than you do at the VP for nearly nine hours a day, and it's going to take longer."
"The fakes, the intestines are changed, not like envelopes."
"Logo on the mouse has only a GI text, and he thinks it's fake because of the distribution stamp. Yuy of course because of the picture on the box and the real sp has different logos so it's confusing..."
"Sensitive: The new quality, new mouse click, new use cannot be made yet. Theship service: The purchase says that TikiNow delivers on the next day (02/05), but buys from 01/05 to 05 to 05 to check the form of the package: always in the condition of transport."
"The schedule is before 10:28 a.m., until 10:30 a.m., until 2th of May 2 new package, and the mouse has tried to make it OK, the same code with the old mouse, but at the turn-off button, there's no green distinguishing as the old one, so it's hard to see, it's not too happy to deliver too slowly and there's little detail on the product."
"The logo on the product and the package isn't the same, the code scan doesn't have any information."
"Mouse is used normally, but it's a bit disappointing because of the small mouse area, if you use a large screen, you have to lift up a couple of times to get to the corner of the screen. The previous mouse is larger, so when using this new mouse, it's a bit uncomfortable."
"It's okay, but it's a little loud. It's a bad delivery."
"The product's okay, but when you buy the product you mark as a gift to your loved ones and you write a greeting note, you don't have a blessing or a note line."
"Second buy, quick break, sensuous mouse, but too bad too many times"
"The pawning mouse is quite handable, carefully packed. However, the mouse has failed to jump the mouse pointer because of the connection between the mouse and reciever with problems, sometimes while moving the mouse, the mouse pointer stands still for about 1 seconds later, the mouse pointer jumps close to its first moving position. This is extremely unpleasant to use."
"It's hard to buy something that hurts because pphas broke the package, so you don't pay it back, so Griswold's taking the money!"
The log Sheet Opens the logo and hangs the goat's head.
"Used to put many of Tiki Traddin's products all right, but this time the wireless mouse failed to turn on the lights while turning on the switch on bàn, although the functions are still normal, without the death stamp as old mice."
"Quick delivery, but I'm sorry, the battery cap's loose, and I hope tiki helps me."
"I'm just buying it up pretty hard, but now I'm feeling that the mouse is going down, and it's not as easy as it was when I bought it, and you'll notice that the next round of the mouse rolls is going to work, and I'm used to using the distance every short time I roll, so I see this line is a little bit of a big distance."
"I got the mouse, and I didn't appreciate it, because the mouse wasn't exactly like the image, and the fake store lacks the word ""tech"", thanks to the contact shop owner to get it back."
"The product doesn't matter, but tiki's shipper is too bad, so call me and yell at me while I'm talking so softly, and I don't know why I'm being scolded."
"The product looks good, the delivery is faster than expected."
It's a quality product.
"Buying Wireless Mouse B175, the company that gave it to the LOGGN mouse."
"Shells and mice aren't the same thing about labels, are they honest sales?"
"The good product, used very well, wrapped up is okay, but only the delivery staff is very poor, calls the customer in an irritative tone, say nothing, and go screaming and hear the wind and be rude and lose his own safety."
It's a small one. It's a nice one.
"The total uncertainty, the liquid battery cap, the off-off button, the roll in the middle, the rustling, the left mouse, right, is not sure that it's not as good as the price and the company itself. It's like buying a product that's made over."
"If we don't get on the lights, we'll never know when the battery's gone."
"I got a package this morning, the mouse didn't work, used the original battery, changed the battery, turned off the switch, didn't have any light, the product didn't scratch anything, it just didn't work at all."
"I bought this mouse around January17, which was really good at first."
"Okay at the price of sale, but why is the lamp under the light when the button is on?"
"The delivery is super fast, we use it for a few months, it's jumpy, it's unstable."
There's only logo logi on the mouse.
It's only been a month.
"The price is reasonable for the office workers, the neat little mouse is to be carried away!"
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Why do you think logi doesn't look like a logo?
"The quality product, the price appropriate, is consistent with the need to use EDI."
"Oh, Shop. K has a flash drive."
No light on the mouselight. The right place to sell to the customer first.
"The product has been cut open, perhaps to attach the battery to the cell phone, and the message will match the women in the office, the moderate sensitivity, the short, smooth click journey."
Fake goods. Requesting backup.
"The company itself, the quality, the package, the price, the price, but the delivery is too slow, perhaps because of disease, to be understanding."
What kind of business is that?
"Only the mouse that is missing is web's head attached to the machine, so it's not working."
"The product can be used, but it's not loggly, it's actually another picture of advertising."
I'd like to ask you to assist me. I've only been able to buy it for 2 days. I can't use it. I hope tiki responds soon.
"Poor product, buying two of them, each of them for more than two months. They're no longer working."
Rats can use but pounds of light on the shop.
"Rats are so sensitive, they're small, but they're a little loud when they click, but at this price I think it makes sense!"
You don't know how to use a battery. Is that exactly 12T?
"I'm perfectly satisfied with this Nintendotech mouse, which lasts two years and is as new and as sustainable as it was at the beginning, changing the batteries once, the mouse fits the palm of the hand, not getting tired of long use, running sensitively on every flat surface, and it's very prestigious, and it's reassuring to buy it from Tiki's own company, so I'm very excited and relieved to use it."
"Rats are fine. If you don't, you don't know."
"I've been spending more than a week, so I don't know if it's me or the mouse."
"If you don't have a Chandler's head, you don't use any of that."
"- The product is well packed, it's got digiworld stamps, it's faster than when it's announced, so I evaluated the two stars."
"It's not even two weeks old, it's still possible, click on the left, roll on the left, then eat on the left."
It's a bad product. It's been last four or four months. It's gone.
Do you think you could spend almost two months on a warrant?
"As soon as we've bought it, it's broken."
It's not like it's on a mouse. It's a fake.
"The goods can be used, but they can't be secured."
It's not a description. I want my product back.
I've spent six months when the left mouse doesn't work.
"Rats still run but don't go on lights, losing faith in products with sellers."
"The mouse battery works normally, but the lights don't light up."
"Three weeks of use, and it's broken."
"I really don't mind if the mouse uses it on November 4th, but it's only been used for a while."
The Logo Mouse isn't Logotech.
sp use ok each tiki wrap box now simplely distorted hip box sp inside lowers the experience
The product is different from the image described
"The outside box of Logotech where sp is in reality only the word “Luidia, ” on the tiki image of sp is also Logotech, and Tiki sells fake pk?"
"Drear shop, why did you deliver the wrong product?"
"The mouse I bought was fine, but I don't know why it's broken, the mouse light is only about 0.8 seconds light and then it's gone."
"You can buy one month of death, you can't even use the battery."
That's fine.
Rats don't light lights.
Rats use umbrellas ae...
This mouse is so light... it's not cool.
"I've just received the package, but the mouse is broken."
Rats don't glow even if they're on.
The quality is also fine for use
"I bought it at 153, but two days later there was a price to 135."
What's wrong with buying a Logi mouse and delivering a mouse?!
"Mouse use sensitivity, gentle click, fit for women, small-handed men."
"I'm not happy that the mouse doesn't work, although the battery has changed many times because it's thought the battery is not going to work, the battery needs to be returned."
"Just got it at noon, but it's still working, but the product doesn't have a light on the battery."
"I don't know, but tiki says delivery in the day, and the next day I'm busy, it's gonna affect shipper."
"You think about buying goods at a high cost that only 16/6 before you get it, 2 o'clock, it's almost a week."
buys logo bms cave logi
"It's fake, it's fake, it shouldn't be bought."
"I read the nx of mn thfi, and most of them have warranty stamps, and my mouse doesn't have one. So if there's something wrong with your mouse, what's wrong with the warranty?"
"You can't buy it yet. Look at the package carefully, I hope tiki keeps the word Kinashi, thanks tiki!"
"I bought four of these mice, one of which has a broken five or six months for them, and the other three for about two or three months."
"It's small, it's appropriate to move around a lot."
"No lights, no rats. It's very smooth. First, buy a smoother one."
Tiki delivers the package on time. <i>Be careful.</i> <i>Mouse ok compared to the price.</i> <i>Smalls fit your arms.</i> <i>But unless you use the mouse and the battery goes along.</i> <i>I don't know if you have an error.</i> <i>I don't know.</i> <i>I don't know if you have a problem.</i>
Different name.
"Unlike the image, web receiver doesn't match very hard to plug into the USB port, the press is too deep when clicking the mouse."
"The mouse I bought so far, it just didn't go up, and it didn't use tiki to fix it for me."
"It's not good, it's not good, it's not good."
"Rats fit in their hands, they're sure, they're sensitive, but clicking feels like they're a little bit of a force, they're also making a sound, so it's not cool."
Okay.
"The Legsharp B175 has small design, so it's easy to hold and manipulate. When you use it, the mouse is very sensitive, the mouse clicks and the mouse moves are very simple and very easy, although on any terrain, the battery is quite sustainable and has a relatively good use of it."
"Wireless mice of this type are beautifully designed, so it is very easy to hold and manipulate. Mouse can be used quite a long way with communication devices (based on blocks or batteries). Mouse has the best sensitivity, the best activity on wooden surfaces or mouse pads. The price is quite high for some other products."
"The shipper is unprofessional, and the stuff's OKie."
"You can't get on the light, you can't use it, you can't even change the batteries."
"I'm not sure if you're gonna be able to buy it for three months, but I'm not sure if you're gonna be able to get it. I'm not sure if you're gonna get it, but I don't know if tiki's got a warrant or not."
"The mouse is very gnarly: <i> despite the mouse pad, the paper, the underwear textbook is still not sensitive:</i> <i>It's just sitting on the tab <i>See how gross it is.</i>"
"It's normal, it's not bad, it's nothing special."
"I'm using this wireless mouse product, which is good and sustainable, product that's designed to fit the palm of the hand, which is very sensitive, which is very easy to use, which works delicately on every plate, batteries that are used for a long time, prices that are fine, and I'm very pleased with this product."
"I've been using Gnaeustech B175 for a while, the battery is good and sustainable, the time is high; the design is small and convenient for taking it out; it's appropriate to work on every terrain; not to mention it can work at a good distance, up to 10 meters, but I'm like other friends who don't like click very much; it's loud because I usually write at night."
"The product is too good, and tiki is too slow now."
"Swallowing the mouse seems a little slow, but it's good to use it a little longer to find out the quality of the ntn."
Why did you lose your tech?
"It's been a month, it's generally stable, it's light, it's short-handed, it's long-term, it's kind of funny, with a non-Charintech mouse, and it's recommended that you choose the unsatisfactory mouse from Carthwaite to have a long-term product, a long-term battery."
Can I have your bill?
"The mouse pointer can't just lie still, shivering and jumping all the time, if you know that the mouse will sell 20K and you won't buy it."
"Because the product is not expensive, the quality is also appropriate, and for those who ask for less than as much about mice as they do, this is a product of choice."
"Digiworld's whole set with batteries available for use, please."
"It's not like the rat has logi's name. It's not like it's a tech, is it? It's a shop owner."
It's easy to use. Okay.
What's wrong with the warranty? I just bought it for a month and a half. It's not working anymore.
"I'm using this mouse, which feels free from the wire, which is really comfortable, and the battery that puts on the mouse is only three months old, and the mouse design that's just holding hands doesn't cause much pain in the hand of the long-term operation."
mouse used well but mouse and kuts are not the same
"The mouse uses very little but is now disabled, unable to connect the server."
"The delivery's too fast, the mouse's running well, the check's onlie's full."
"If we're gonna use it on anything, give it to each mouse, we can't use it or we can't use it."
"It's pretty low and it's broken, it's stuck, it's right, it's disappointed."
"A beautiful model mouse, but you've been rolling around all the time, and sometimes you've been in a hurry?"
"Bad mouse, ask for a change."
"I paid in front of you with MOMO, but I didn't get the delivery yet. How do you check the form that says it's a success?"
It's not very smooth in Saigon.
The present is good.
It's not very sensitive and there's no light. I don't understand why?
"We need to help with the milk, we need to buy two that one won't be able to use."
Okay.
"Rats buy August 19th, the first month is good."
Use it well after a month's use.
"The mouse's good, it's good, it's good, but the middle button's too hard and it's too loud and the price's too good."
"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no., no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no., no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no., no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no"
invalid queues can't be used
"Okay, okay. Let's go. Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go!"
It's normal. It fits the price range.
"Used to buy this wireless mouse more than a year ago, it's bad enough to buy it. Light, easy to move, quite pleased."
"At first, it seemed okay to use it, and I didn't have much to use, so I don't know."
"When you're done, you're out using lightlights, although they're still working."
"I've spent four times in a month, and I've replaced three energize batteries."
"It's a brand new box, but it doesn't show any lights, it doesn't work. It's not available, it's not available, it's not available, it's not available. It's not available, it's not available, it's not available. It's required to change the new one."
"2 o'clock, 2 weeks!"
"Mouse use smooth, quick delivery"
"Looks like, use ok, match the price."
It's pretty fresh. I don't know if it's sustainable.
I bought this mouse for two months. I can't use it.
"Quick delivery, whole seal.Bits out now, battery records in one year so time to respond."
"What do you mean, the lights don't go up?"
"I bought it three times, I used it pretty good, Tiki's services were good."
There's no light on when you get your mouse clicks.
"I've been using more than a month, and I've been doing okay, except it's been pretty good, but it's kind of annoying to me that I'm working at night."
"Tiki delivers as quickly as possible, packed carefully, fully new mouse."
The delivery store's not exactly the model.
y shape product
Mouse on four planes: A4 paper face: extremely low mouse-heading: A little bit of table face and book cover: Good
The Logo Mouse is very poor - utterly disappointed
"Picked up line 10/03, 2021."
That's why we're buying it all the time.
This mouse is cheap and very OK of logs.
No warranty stamp.
Look: real color doesn't look like shape. Black gray figure that's black. Quality: I haven't seen anything in a few minutes. I don't know if it's sustainable.
"The log line is getting worse, it doesn't work, it doesn't work."
"I don't know if it's going to be as good as the last few times, and the box is open, and it's probably going to be checked or whatever, because it's still on the outside, and it's going to be fine, and there's a battery inside, and it's not going to be so big, and it's not going to be so good, and it's going to be good, and it's going to be good."
The delivery's too slow...
"The delivery is fast, the clicks are very simple. Okay, smooth."
It takes more time to use it.
"The product is good enough, so it's good enough."
"It's a little small for my hand, but it's okay to use it for a while to see if it's going to run out of batteries."
"There's not been any wireless rats, there's been too much trouble with a mouse, and it's been a long time since tiki's getting a discount, and she's buying it, and that's a fastship, and the night before she puts it, the package was packed, but she didn't see the warranty, so she's worried about it, and she's saying she's got a year's got it, and she's hoping she doesn't ask a lot about it."
Fake Logo is not Logotech.
mouse use ok but light does not have
"I've just bought a very nice package, and I don't know what I'm talking about, but I don't know what I'm talking about."
The logi label is the log of a kimono
"Quick delivery, carefully packed, but the quality of the product is not high, left mouse sometimes has not clicked and received."
I haven't received TiKi yet.
"Rats, ticks, jumps, they're not quality, they're wrong for you to read them, they're wrong for you."
"I got a new mouse for two months, and it's broken and it's broken."
It's not very sensitive.
Rats are fine at a price range.
Cool.
Slow delivery.
Okay.
Mouse jumps around. Opens two excel files. It's not possible to go from file to file. It's very disappointing.
"It's a little small for the hand, it's a nice touch, it's a good sound, it's smooth, it's nice."
Two months without a signal.
Okay.
"It's small, it's small, it's space-saving."
Mouse does not work clmn
"Four stars for this product, which is very good. I've spent about 10 months and I've seen nothing wrong with it."
"Tiki delivers the package on time, well wrapped, loaded with batteries for use. The initial use is good, smooth, sensitive. Mouse should not have seen a light that does not appear to be in the battery."
"It's good, it's good, it's good, it's quick, it's packed, it's got rats, it's a portal, it's a battery."
"It's perfect, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, but there's a problem with delivery time, and I put this one on April 1st, and it's not until 11.4 to pick up the other websites, and I like to buy it on Tiki because of the product, which is obviously the source of the product, but I'm a little disappointed in the delivery time, and I hope Tiki will fix this point."
"It's okay, I don't know how long it takes, I don't know how long it takes."
"Rats are good, batteries are available, but the delivery is too long to be delivered for more than a week."
Fine.
"The mouse size is small compared to the male hand size, the signal is not really good, the drag operation is also impossible to match the stringed mouse."
"It's only been a week since I've been a mouse. He's been jumping around, has tiki been supporting us?"
Normal
slow
"I can use it, but I'll be worn out soon."
"Or you can lose the connection. You can't move, you can't move, you can't move, you can't move, you can't move, you can't move, you can't move, you can't move, you can't move, you can't move, you can't move, you can't move, you can't move, you can't move, you can't move, you can't move, you can't move, you can't move, you can't move, you can't move, you can't move, you can't move."
"The hand-held product, the original battery, is very sustainable, I've spent more than a year, and then I've got to put my battery in place once or twice a month, and I don't like it, but the price that tiki has to sell this battery is great."
It's delicious at a price.
"The quality isn't good. Uses a few days, but the reflection isn't sensitive."
Suppression is fine.
...
"Small, simple, beautiful product."
"Let's try the battery. All right, let's get the time we need to use it. No hands."
Okay.
"Light product, good glide."
"The mouse line is heavily covered, and it's full, and it's pretty impressive, and it's pretty cheap, and it's not dead, or there's no signal."
It's a little small for the hand. It's pretty smooth.
"The mouse's pretty heavy, it's not smooth, it's not bright."
Hand over very fast
"The keyboard and the mouse that I use are very common because the price is medium, but it's very sustainable and smooth, so I'm going to introduce my friends to buy this mouse."
"It's a bit small, it's small, it's a little small, it's a little big, it's probably not going to be comfortable."
"Rats use it very well, but it's a very loose package."
"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no., no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no"

"This wait buys a quick delivery camera, which takes 13 days, 8 days of work."
"I love this mouse, and it's easy to have a nice little design, and it's a good time to buy it, and it's a good time to go down, and it's a good thing, but the click is a little loud and late at night is a lot of money, and it's a lot of money and it's a good thing for people to use laptops."
"For the first time, the feeling is that it's small, beautiful, and very handy, and the quality of it is a little bit more expensive than any other place, but hopefully the product is sustainable because it's a Bitcocile."
"Sensitive Mouse, Light"
"The rat's too bad, he never buys it again."
"When the mouse scroll has a reputation, doesn't like it, the other one doesn't have this problem, so hopefully there's going to be a change in the future."
I don't know. I don't know.
"Rats are cheap, satisfied."
Error after 3 days of use.
How long does this product last?
"Mk thinks that each mk mk has a bug, but reading a lot of people have, where does kpit pay off?"
"The normal product, this low sensitivity price, doesn't expect much more."
"Tiki delivers as fast as the wind, the new mouse tries it with sensitivity, okay?"
Unsympathetic Mouse
"Quick delivery, well packed, as described by the product, thank you tiki."
"It's a real rat, Ship, it's got a real stamp!"
"Lorbeth mouse product is good, delivered quickly"
"Rats are sensitive, they're fast, they're mouse-speeded and they're still sensitive."
Good.
Not so sensitive!
Good.
The scroll button sometimes doesn't work.
I just bought this mouse.
"The delivery is slow, think of it two or three days in which, over a week, the delivery officer's attitude is not good."
"It's normal, it's not cool, it's not bad, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's not bad."
I don't know what to do.
Kkk
Good within the price range.
"Good, hopefully."
"Mouse does well, but the light below does not burn when it is used"
"I bought this mouse to replace the Newmen F278, which is a little higher than the price, and the code doesn't look as good as it really is."
"Every time I buy in Tiki, I'm very happy, and Tiki delivers fast, and I'm very careful with it, and I have these comments: small, clean, steady hands, long time without batteries, so many terrains, falling but not so hard."
Good within the price range.
"A quality product, a bag of cash."
"Advantage: + Small, pretty cool design + Pin is very sustainable + press and mouse travel is very easy + Tiki is very neat, careful with these points: + price is expensive compared to the market. In general, it's a good product, it's good to buy. I'm quite pleased with this product."
It's pretty stable and good to use.
"The lights on the battery are damaged, the rats are sensitive on almost every surface."
"The product is relatively good, the price is reasonable"
Good at price range.
It's good compared to the price. sd a week oke. it's small size compared to the hand.
"The mouse's too temporary, pulling the baby down too loud."
hand-held mouse
Let's use quick transport.
"The delivery is on time, the rats are good."
"It's pretty good! I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, so buy it."
"The product's pretty good, but it's a little small for the hand."
"The log line is off the table, always running good and smooth, gently, tiki delivered on the same day, packaged well, but this little girl's code is a little rough, for the male, I don't know if there's any other colors, some more pink or something."
I don't like this product.
It's not a light. It's a shop. It's a bad day.
Just got it. The battery cover's not tight.
"All right, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go!"
I'm happy. For four. Good sp.
Satisfaction
"The product ok, however not sharp in its form"
Okay.
Pack it well.
I'm not happy that the mouse doesn't work.
Rats run well.
"Tiki delivers fast, middle-class mouse quality, mouse clicks OK, but the mouse roll isn't comfortable."
"Now I see good use, reasonable price, no sustainable bill, right?"
It's normal. It's small.
"Fast delivery, carefully packed mouse use, slightly loose battery cap"
Satisfaction
Good.
Okay.
I can use them.
Slow delivery.
"Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay."
I'm fine.
Okay.
Rats use sensitivity but a little small for their hands.
Okay.
"Fine price competitive, carefully packaged, fastship."
"The mouse is too hard, DPI is low, and the mouse is heavy"
"Rats are also quite sensitive, though not exactly as wired mice, good batteries."
"Good product, sensitive product, bad delivery!"
"Got the package, packed well, and pretty good, trying to feel pretty good about it."
"The delivery is slow compared to the sensitive mouse plan, the loud click, the battery"
"The mouse is pretty good. It's still alive, it's still alive, it's still alive, and sometimes it's probably because of the trauma. It's okay."
"It's a beautiful form, but it's less than a meter distance."
"You don't know the quality yet, but you don't see the light."
"It's really annoying to roll around, but Tiki's playing the same stuff."
"A good product at such a price, it's only a small mouse compared to the user's hand."
"It's nice, it's good, but you need a mouse pad when you use it, so it's a little uncomfortable."
"It's a little hard, it's not smooth, it's a lot of money."
"The pattern's OK, but the quality's too good for the people in the office."
"She used to run really well and just now, so she's a rat."
"Good use, broad range, quick delivery."
"Tiki's delivery on schedule, and the mouse's pretty sensitive, well-groomed, hand-to-handed, black for both men and women, and they don't know the quality yet."
"The moment the mouse takes it very, very involuntary, and the tiki waits for a discount, so I've got this non-second mouse, and it's very expensive, and it's very professional, so I'm very pleased."
"I've been using this product for a very short time, the initial feeling of quality is pretty good, the smooth roll, it's quite sensitive, the fancy design, it's certainly, and it's pretty sustainable, and it's pretty good use time, but I still haven't had to change it, but the click is pretty loud, making some noise and a little bit uncomfortable for me to use."
"I used the same string mouse before, and then I switched over using wireless mouse because it was convenient and now it's more common. The wireless mouse of logs is very sensitive, clicks and moves the mouse very simply, and it's easy to move the mouse. Usually the wireless mouse when it comes in later, it's time to plug in, and the keyboard has to be more sensitive to move, but the mouse plugs should be able to run out of batteries, or whatever."
"No Wireless Mouse Legsharp B175 has small, hand-held design, long-term batteries, sensitive mice, suitable to people who play games like themselves. Because they're wireless mice, they're convenient to use. They cost a little bit of money to students like themselves, but they're worth the quality."
"So, both left-handed and right-handed people, very suitable for their computers, and their brothers are left-handed."
"The mouse is pretty good, and it's tough and it's saved its battery for about a year and especially it's easy to move because there's no wires, and I'm going to go to a watery place where there's Wi-Fi to go online, and it's usually a very light amount of mouse mass, and it's especially about using mice that usually make noise that I don't like, if there's a way to reduce the noise of using mice that's going to be better."
"The mouse is very sustainable, the design is strong. The battery is very soft and very sensitive. The battery is very long because it has a ""sleep"" mode when you're not using it for long enough to turn off the ""off"" button. I've bought most of the year without changing the batteries. But the thing is that in the quiet evening the mouse click will hear noise, and especially if you play the regular mouse click, you won't be able to sleep nearby."
"A lot of easy-to-use ports. It makes sense. Nice design. Thank you, shop."
"Steady connection, small sharp hub, very fast delivery time."
Use OK.
Any good thing that connects the gate will work.
Good.
"The correct row of descriptions, stable connections, ports."
The hdmi output isn't working.
"The best roll, the clean mouse, the quiet click, if it's a little higher, the two buttons on the side are a little higher, and the other drop is perfect, and the price is high, but it's worth the job."

"Quality product, as expected."
"Soft, smooth, fast-rolled mouse move."
"Specially favorite. Very good plastic: Small but full of keys, perfecting space. Presses are smooth and silent. Presses are not cheaply bent, keys are much better than their Remittude laptop keys. In general, at a price of about 200k, there is nothing to blame for."
"The brand's keyboard is famous and the price is too cheap, the big keyboard and the type is very smooth, I bought two."
"Handing it over like the wind, she's happy."

"SP well, wait to see if there's a key stuck after a while sd k?"
"The touch key is smooth, the key tap is non-smoking, great."

The volume is sensitive to the sound of the audio outside. If the battery was 100 percent, then it was OK."

The package's broken. The screen's also delivered.
Everything's good except sp:) It's really hard to use when there's no guidance.

"The Shop is not clear, so it's easy for customers to misunderstand, and when asked, there's no support... there's never a second time, you should be careful to read it before you order it."
"The pick-up rat's scratched and dirty, so it's urgent that they don't return it."
"Pay up, you're doing a quick delivery job, and you're getting blown up like this."

Could not close temporary folder: %s
"You buy one week's worth of batteries left in the box, you charge it automatically, and then every time the battery's out of the earphone, you plug it in like a video it's newly charged, or you lose, you don't get it."
"The ear can hear every beautiful, well-contacted design, and it sounds really bad and it can't hear very bad, and there's a little bass, and it's all high-sounding, and it can't hear, and it can't catch and delay as it's called. It's so disappointing for one earset, it's almost 700K, and it's brand-new."
"The ear is fine, the sound is clear, the bag combined, but it's long gone. It's disconnected, it's short-term, but it's still okay."
"Everything's fine, but you can't hear 30 minutes, you can't stand it, even if it's only a quarter of the volume."
"Bluetooth's only got one ear, no clear direction."
I'm fine.
A little heavier than my ears.
Let me ask you where you can't hear the button.
"Poor quality of sound, lots of lies."
It's okay if you're not sensitive to sound.
That's great..4.75.
"Fast delivery. T6 puts the seventh one in place, turns it upside down. Mouse is extremely sensitive, very likes it. nice, neat, easy to move, easy to type, unfortunately no Capsack lights, so the number's a little uncomfortable."
"The keyboard is designed simply, the keys are low-responsive, good feedback, the surface of the keyboard curved with gentle round edges. The keyboard is made of good materials, resulting in tenacity during long-term use. Mouse has a solid structure, embraces the palm of the hand, modern optical sensors allow mice to move smoothly, gently, and accurately above most surfaces. Mouse uses batteries easily to replace the use of a battery in the process"
"Beautiful pattern, great quality, lots of connections, smart TVs, laptops."
"Use quick delivery service and really fast delivery. The keypad has a short-clicking route, so it's not like the regular big-key keyboard. Mouse fits hands. Easy to use, just install batteries and heads to use. It's generally good for exchange prices and services."
After some time of use is evaluated as follows.1. Package and deliver 2 carefully.
"ok the keyboard is delicious, no caplock + numlocks, so sometimes not able to write and number. The keyboard is small but full of key functions, the girl's hand, the mouse is too smooth, so it's got to go to win for sensitivity.) The tiki company itself sells too quiet. The delivery is too fast on time."
"Nice sp. No lights on the mouse, still running smooth, quality waiting time."
"Soft keyboard, smooth mouse. I don't know how long to use it. I'm fine with it. Every crime on F-keys is not exactly the same as my usual keyboard, so I'm a little bit confused."
"Light keys, small sounds, very good"
"Start catching Wirepa in the box shell, not in the mouse, not in the battery."
"Shipper delivers fast, planning Saturday, but Friday is delivered. The keyboard is much bigger than you imagine, it's a sensitive type, which is like an ancient telegram, big buttons are good for older people. Mouse is very nice to connect quickly through a web port, however it looks fragile than the keyboard. I buy it when it's down, it's pretty good for combom keys."
"The mouse is smooth enough Full Full size familiar with the Mini-Scroller, plug in your laptop still art. Very pleased."
"The keyboard is soft, soft, sensitive. The mouse has been sensitive. It has just opened up without being able to see the transceiver in the mousech, who is holding onto the box without noticing."
The quick delivery press key
"You know, it's awful fast. I always mean Wednesday. The plan is to come next Monday, next Friday, but always from Friday, and the keyboard's kind of smooth, but the mouse's a little low, and it's gonna get a little tired of your hands."
"The product looks sharp, the press is quiet, the connection is stable. However, without the Numlock, CapLock, Insert, so who needs to know the state of these buttons will be a little uncomfortable."
The keyboard and the mouse are fine; simply plug and play! including the battery to the keyboard + mouse. The delivery is “Felling Speed. Very pleased.

"The product is exquisite, especially how to attach the receiver and deliver it to the guests."

"Good. Although the gap between the keys is so close, type or touch another key, it takes a little time to get used to it."
That's exactly how I described it.

"The good product, the quick connection, the point is there's no capslock nemlock."
"The keyboard is good quality, but I'm a keyboard programmer with high keyboards and keyboard shortcuts, and the keys are close to each other, so I'm easy to miss, maybe not used to, but this is really good quality."
"Okay, three months use. No trouble."
"Tiki delivers on time, good, good product, continue to support tiki"

"It's not about quality, it's about Tiki delivery that's a little small, but it's not in its place, it's falling inside the box, makes you think you're short, afraid of blue!"
Keyboard quality is fine compared to price. Large keys are easily typed

"The keys are fine, the delivery hasn't gone very fast in Hanoi"
I don't think it's possible to buy it at tiki Tranding that's this sloppy package that's always going to be worth it for you.
Cheap
Another setpoint is a whole option. It's too smooth. It's been spent a week. It's good. It's worth it.
"I used short-term products and felt that they were very good, very valuable, thank you tiki."
"The keyboard and the mouse are beautiful. The keyboard is very popular, the mouse can be used on every surface. Tiki delivers as quickly as possible."
"I just bought this product and failed to use it, and the keyboard button didn't work."
"The key is quite light, mouse and sensor key. The compact design fits a 15.6 laptop"""
"The keyboard is nice, nice. However, no lights on the CAPS LG key, so it's a little uncomfortable."
"Nice, nice, fair price."
The delivery is fast and not expensive. It's okay.
"Nice product, fair price quality."
"The keyboard is soft, the fingers are smooth, but the mouse is not sensitive to the computer, but when the mouse is torn down and the mouse is delayed. I try to use thepad or other mouse, which is normal."
"Fast delivery, but the mouse uses normal but doesn't know how the table is connected to the computer, thanks to tiki's guidance, or if any of you know how to help."
"My first mistake was not looking at dates until half a month before the second mistake was laid at TiKii's trust to settle the date for 15 days but 19 days was too slow to get four days before I set the other floor, even from the HCM, only four days later."
"Tiki delivers as quickly as possible, and the keyboard smooths up enough keys such as common keyboards (the regrettably no capslocks). The mouse Mouse is not less than 10 meters [10 m] behind. This is cheap mouse keyboard for office users within range."
"I haven't used it yet, but I'm just trying to change my evaluation."
Lowship Bolt Usb receiver
"Received goods, Tiki delivers quickly; product compared to bad quality prices, bad keyboards, slow mouse reactions, or no reaction to putting them on the surface of wooden paper. disappointed compared to high prices."
"Soft typing keyboards, mice are smooth, but sometimes the tài key outside does not receive the signal at all, but it does not matter. There are two screen buttons for free, but fast delivery, carefully packaged packages."
"His mouse keyboard is capable of failure, often delay and short-term."
"The package is good, the batteries, the quality of the material is fine, but it's unstable, the computer's only one meter away from the computer, and sometimes it's twitching!"
"I love this suit, but it's only last May that the mouse has a problem now, which is not sensitive, which goes up and down and gets jerked, which is sometimes a keyboard that doesn't eat, which has to be turned off, and then plugs back in and out, and then uses it again, baby."
"Nice, handy, easy-to-use, packaged, soft keyboard typed, but when a mouse is set about five meters away, the mouse is not sensitive, although the information is 10 meters away."
"The keyboard has lag, the type that can't even show up, wants to trade it for something that doesn't know who it is anymore."
"The product I'm not talking about, but I'm so disappointed with the CSA, the operator is always busy. Even though the power is low, Email gets feedback in 24 hours, but it's been four days."
"When you buy it, the mouse and the keyboard have lad, but think that since the ram is slow, you can change the ram, the keyboard and the mouse will get more and better, and after a while of use, you'll feel very unhappy, very uncomfortable."
I'd like to change it for the first time. Don't let the customers lose faith.
"Advancing: Accurate mouse, smooth presspad, strong brand, has batteries in sp, and batteries in your service for a long time. ex: The small mouse forms with the hand tired, the bulild keypad."
There's nothing to say but the title.
I checked in the box and the mouse still hasn't seen USB Bluetooth.
"The manufacturer of flat and low keys made it very easy to type the wrong key. After four months of use, there was either delay or a disconnect (very frustrating for the user to handle the job)."
"I bought this set of webs on my computer, the case on my foot and the table and the mouse on my desk, which is usually okay, but when I'm playing games, I'm going to move my mouse so I'm going to spin the screen, and I'm going to have a picture, like a mouse that doesn't respond to speed or something. When I'm using another wireless mouse, it's normal to play with a keyboard, so it's not very good."
"The keyboard and the mouse work well after a few weeks of use. The little mouse uses a lot of hand tired. The gray is not black, so buying MK315 Quiettov is a little bit more expensive, same type of keyboard, but the mouse is much better."
"When I got the keyboard, the seal of the box was torn, the lack of mouse, the loss of the battery => Pays the trade after three long weeks, the seal of the box was still torn down, there was a mouse but there was a USB link to the device => Paying the overwhelming disappointment for Tiki's product quality and service attitude, promising to respond a lot of times, slow information and promises to the customers."
"It's okay, it's small, it's smaller than the big hand, it's much smaller than the B100 mouse."
"I bought these two, six months of extremely disappointing use, keyboards, short-term responses, delays, and specials, as soon as the batteries run out, I'd like to ask how tiki preserves."
"I've bought a lot of Tiki's, but this time I've missed a lot, and I've got a short on both keypads and wireless mice, so I can't use them."
"It's nice, but it's hard. It's OK. It's cool, it's cool, it's cool, it's cool, it's cool, it's cool, it's cool, it's cool, it's cool, it's cool, it's cool, it's cool, it's cool, it's cool, it's cool."
"I got the goods from last week but didn't open, and yesterday when I opened them, I found that the mouse had no USB ports to communicate with."
"The product we're using doesn't see a problem, each of which is a purchase from another person, and the same old bill on sp."
"it's cheaper than other words. but this keypad is very loose. on a kprinter, without warranty, ntn."
"The goods have bought for some time, quality, simple connections, and mouse use ok."
"The keyboard and the splitr three meters in the middle are the rails, which knock empty-handedly:"
"I've been using it for two days, but there's been a long shot, slow connection, especially Space key, C key and V key."
"The keyboard responds well, there is no delay, there is no ease, but the mouse is too bad. The mouse has to be no good, the mouse has to be ripped off over and over again."
"Sell the key, the main mouse. Type the spot... except for no nem,cap. It's fine compared to the price range."
The keyboard is as fragile as a child's toy.
"I just got the keyboard today, but when I opened it, I didn't see the little web attached to the computer to connect to this set, so why use it:((()"
"Beautiful Oke, big keyboard, private key, sensitive mouse, and on-off buttons."
It's sad to buy it for two days when rats and keyboards don't eat it.
"The newly attached is very quick; but when you start working, typing is slow; lag; the letter follows."
"Because it's almost as cheap as Logo's combo, it doesn't expect too much, it doesn't look as good as a higher-price product, it's good to buy it, because it's safe to use it."
"The keyboard seems a little bit stiff, I think it's black, but it's gray, but it's okay, but it looks a little weird. Perfect quality seems good, heavy hand, the press has a loud noise. The whole round shape is soft. Mouse seems a little small compared to the hand, the mouse rolls well, although pressing the scroll key doesn't work very well, those who draw more cad won't like it."
"Mouse does not have a laptop plug-in device to receive a signal, mouse plugs in the battery without working."
"It's hard to type, it's narrow, it's easy to miss."
The price makes sense.
Keyboard and Mouse Click a little hard
"No web heads, no mouse."
"Tiki delivers fast, soon compared to the expected two days. But: Very disappointed by the lack of mouse heads (receiver), or keyboard, which is distorted."
Get the product very quickly but without the plug-in device (head USB)
"Mouse and keyboard shared receiver which keyboards constantly lose mouse waves bth, which support changing other keyboards"
"Sensitive keys, however, are limited."
"Slow signal, late-deposit, not compatible with the graphical worker, has to return one at a time!"
"The mouse gets broken sometimes, and the table is good, but there's no basic signal lights like capslock, but... it's generally good."
"The mouse is very good, the touchy touch is good for many surfaces. The keyboard is a bit silly, though the key is soft but not sensitive, sometimes it's a bit deep, it's a little low. The color of style is pretty nice, it's pretty good to put it on the table. If you're using it, you're going to have to unmount the battery, you don't know what's wrong with it, but at this price, it's acceptable."
"The keyboard is slightly light and too fast to be stuck with keys and letters. If there is a condition of buying muscle keys, it may be better."
"I bought these two, I used them well, I was stable, I used them so easily to replace them, I was quite pleased with the product."
The second key set has been changed. Too bad for a product of logs. It's boring to say. There's no next time.
The back mouse won't be able to use the shop.
"A light keyboard, disliked by typing. Mouse and keyboard do not use Unifying Receiver, so if lost, you may have to buy a whole new set."
"The log keyboard MK235 you're sensitive to, but you're not so good at it!"
"I'm connected to Mac Air 207. The speed is as sensitive as Mac's sensors, and it's recommended that the Mac users buy it."
"It's good, but it's a week later than expected."
Mouse and keyboard sharing receiver is not very flexible when using multiple machines
"The combo isn't retail, but if the retailer buys a keyboard, doesn't buy a mouse, a good keyboard, a rat can't stand it."
"The keyboards are a bit squeamish, the mice are okay."
"- The keyboard's pretty good at the price - the mouse's got lag and jerked, the mouse's a little small. Use it a little bit longer."
It's okay. The rat's a little thin. I don't know the hand.
"The good product, the mouse alone, is in the process of using the product, so we're waiting for the durability of the product."
A month's worth of rats are broken.
"The quality used well, the color is actually gray, but Tiki delivers from other places too slowly, often taking more than a week to get SP."
"Disregarding Reveever, waiting for tiki to change: (I hope shop and tiki learn from it)"
"Two days can be used when a mouse twitches, a key is disabled"
"Mouse products are very good, but keyboards are slow to react, and they sit and sit and wait for new words to come out, and they're still the same."
"I've been buying from 17/6 so far, I can't get any of my e-mails, and I'm told, ""Please wait a second."
"Good product, pretty sensitive keyboards, good for Sony smart TV."
As you wish.
It's too slow. Ten days to pick up.
Sometimes out of sight.
"Prices are cheap, so completion is not high. Mouse ok but the keyboard is not soft when type sounds like plastic doesn't go well."
On
"You're missing a battery, and you're drawing carelessly these days."
Keyboards sometimes lose their signal.
"Fast delivery, carefully wrapped, steady keyboard"
Good.
"Hi, we put the battery in, the keyboard rat gets it, but the mouse doesn't light the light."
"Just got the package, the code OK, the mouse and the keyboard are delay 1.1 seconds into use."
"Mouse & keyboards are sensitive, typing soft keys"
"Take the flash drive, get paid. Put another one on the table."
Connect to unsympathetic desktops
"Keyboard and wireless mouse use good, standard, economic."
Quality matching price to price
Types are light and smooth
"In accordance with office work, using OK, the next price goes down, right?"
"Many percusses do not eat, have to type very hard. The suggestion is to change."
Pleased with this product
Good stuff.
It's a bit of a push.
"It's okay to start with, but I don't know if it's sustainable."
Take out my two keycards. (((((()))
"Generally good product, the feeling of pressing isn't as good as expected, but at this price price is acceptable."
"Use sensitivity, good, appropriate for office workers to help clean his work space."
"Quick, without a lot of settings, the keyboard signal is a little weak if it's far away from the head of the income."
"The product of the shallow and hard buttons, not very familiar with everyday office activities,"
"Keyboards can press multiple buttons, but often the speed of processing is limited"
"The keyboard is good, the mouse is too small, and the person who buys the big mouse holds it with no hands."
"The keyboard's good, the mouse's good, the light's not visible, so it's very dark."
"It's handy, it's small, it's new, it's not sustainable."
"I can't help it, I can't stand it, I can't stand it, I can't stand it, I can't stand it!"
"Ae can use these earpieces to listen to mine-sharp music, and the sound is quite good in this price, but the connection quality doesn't say 10 meters is that in case there's no port material, there's two feet high, and the magnet is extremely low, and this one's pretty high, and this one's pretty high, and I don't encourage ae to buy a game."
"The product's good for the price, everybody, but there's been a mistake in the delivery, but the store's settled, and it makes me believe in online purchases."
"Let's get Chandler, bass OK, copy that. Fingerprints are good at the price, nice, non-scrapted, two-hour delivery, so it takes time to evaluate the quality."
It's very smooth and very good.
"Right ear sample, full charge line, package shop careful also, sound OK"
"Since this is a cheap ear, so let's not hope for five stars, but let's not be the two-second model, the one with the plastic lid, the one with the tiara, the one without the magnet, the other without the magnet, the one with the earphone, the one with the same price, sometimes with the sound of one to two seconds, the one with the extra cap, and the one with the extra price, and you should consider, if there's more finance, there's no hope that there's so there's no hope that there's a lot more of us that we can hear, five stars, four, for the store, for the sake."
"Shop the package. Check the package before you give it to the ear client. It's a great sound. Okay, it's a great lockup."
"Well, it's very good to expect small manufacturers to hear a little bit of pain, and a little bit of pain, and a little bit of pain, and a lot of good."
"The product is fine, it sounds very loud, it's very soundable, it's sensitive, it's connected fast."
"The sound is very good, the only thing is that the sound is a little bit weak, but I like it because I'm still on the street listening to the sound of the car, and many of you are saying you can't change the volume and you can't read the instructions, and the way the fixer says one ear in the book is to turn off the two ears and turn them on at the same time as the 10s."
"Pretty pleased with sp, going to introduce and support the shop, if more batteries are great, shipper is kind of friendly, cheerful."
"Sound hearing, noise resistance, quiet bass, steady cell phone, four o'clock, five o'clock, fine at the price range."
"Which money, folks, positive is that it's okay at the price point. If you want to be okay, you'll be able to spend a little more money on other kinds of stuff. Okay?"
"Just got a couple of hours of goods on schedule, called the goods, the goods, the good ones, the good ones, the good ones, the bad ones, the bad ones, the bad ones, the good ones, the good ones, the good ones, the good ones, the big ones."
The good product fits the price.
"The product compared to this price price is very fine, the battery is fine, the quick charge has the original stamp, so it's safe to focus on the minus the small point is the charge charge without the power, and the mark on the ear is only the L and the durability of it."
"It's a great quality sound. It's very carefully packed. It's just a match bag, but it's a package sized cake."
"New to use sound good, quality ok, package careful, black style"
Good quality ok though it was hard to connect at first.
It's not paid back for a year. It hasn't been paid for a five-star evaluation.
"The beautiful product, like the sample, the two earpieces are long enough to be four or five hours too good for the product under 200k. And the backup charge must be meant to be, charged as no."
"You just bought two designed sounds, you have to say it's cheap at the price."
"Nice product, sometimes lose a reputation, but at this rate, it's okay. It's good."
"It's all right, don't look at it. It's all there. It's all there in the hdsd paper."
"I'm fine. I'm fine, I'm fine. I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine."
"Old, but persistent, soft, henndnskskkdx"
"OK, good. I'm happy to thank you for the shop."
"Well, compared to the price range, okay, that's okay. It's a long way to go."
"Nice pattern, nice package, good sound."
"The quality product, got it at noon, didn't see it okay, but I don't know what's wrong with it in a few days."
That's great.
It's because you watch chats every time you're on zero.
"The product is exactly the way it's described, the quality is good, but the sound's a little small, but it's still five stars."
Good quality for playing games.
"You just bought it and okay with the product, and you'll have to figure it out later, but you'll have to hold it very well."
It's only been three days before you've lost one ear.
"The battery's not heavy, it's super mic, the battery's not very heavy, but okay."
Good.
One battery takes five hours to lose sound. Okay.
"The headset's good, it's good. It's good to read the instructions. Okay, it's good to go."

It's a pleasure.
I've tried it under 100K. It's okay.
It's good stuff. It's been a long time. Okay.
"Quick delivery, quality good."
"It's cheap, it's fast delivery. It's easy to use sensors that are difficult to use, but it's still for five seconds."
It's either the art or the balance of the battery.
"The product is packaged. OK, ears are on both sides. The guy delivers the package passionately."
Quick
The delivery is 10 days faster than expected. The product is exactly the way it's supposed to be.
That fits the price price.
"It's easy to connect, it doesn't sound bad."
Bull batteries sound good. This is the third one I bought. The last one I lost. It's not broken.
That's exactly the model of quick delivery.

"One. The incomplete information is not true. The web says: ""Create access to devices that are connected to MPD devices, the phones..."". However, receiving non-connected drugs with remote laptops.2. Unconsistencies of shop: commitment to ""open the package checkbox"". However, having just opened up, trying to connect with the laptop (the main purpose of buying this ear), detects no connection, has not yet been used, informs even to the tiki; then the donors constantly ask if they have not been tested, and has not been connected. See if they have used a laptop, don't support for this connection. How does this connection go on a common basis?"
I've spent three days spraying one ear.
"Sound quality is fine compared to price, full of quick delivery supplies"
"The earphones only show %d for a while and then off for about two and a half hours, the plug-in battery is not available when you're two seconds behind. Listen to the music. OK, but it's a little low quality."
"The generals, this is a cheap, stable ear, can be used for temporary burns, black looks pretty catchy and turn-up. the connection is fine within 2 feet. the sound is quite low, it's suitable for music. The delivery is relatively fast."
Sound is good at this price. delivers Tikinow quickly. Use time is not known for long.
"Set up the Bluetooth hearing order, delivery shop for the charge cable."
"The hearing is always bright, the battery's running fast, the shop won't answer, you can't give it back."
The quality is pretty good compared to the price.
The headset just bought two headsets. He didn't come in. This is the second time we've bought it.
The delivery's too slow. We've got to get to the lockdown.
"I've got the goods, I've got the same product as the semi-selling product, but there's one detail about the charge line that the charge doesn't work, and I've tried to plug into the USB alley on my computer or use the loose charge."
"We've got a weak phaser connection, listening to the music, and it's going to be shut down for a few minutes, and it's a two-second toner."
The product failed to be used
"It's a good connection, but it's not a good quality of sound, it's just for listening, it's for fun, it's for whatever it is."
It's good to use it.
"It's like two months of damage on one side, and it's kind of corny."
The sound screen doesn't go up on the right. It doesn't sound bad.
"It's not a commercial, it's a two-hour time limit."
The ear can only hear one side of a poor quality.
The cave delivers two and a half pounds of dkkm.
"Four days, four days of advertising, two broken ones, the rest of the battery, the battery's full, so the joway's gone."
The package is not quality. K is used because one of the ears is broken and the bin is up.
SPILLS or.va or closes the sound itself. The dump is uncomfortable. Requesting repossessing sp.
"The charge from the container to the earpiece is loose, so the charge is occasionally free."
"The earpiece only hears one side, because the one side that doesn't show the charge bin may be damaged, and I've texted the store that doesn't answer, and if you buy it, you'll have to consider it."
"I ordered more than a month's worth of money, and I didn't deliver it to me, and then text it, and I answered it, and I didn't deliver it, and I didn't give it back."
"I got it, but I don't like it, but it's not exactly like QC. It's a three-meter connection."
Son of a bitch.
"I heard an ear. I heard an ear, but I couldn't hear it."
"The delivery is the right model, but there's no charge cable, so it's four stars."
"The product's off-line, and the product's off-line, and the product's off-limits, and the product's off-line."
The battery's dead. The battery's gone. It's only for the headset. It's less than two days.
There's been a blackout on the battery.
"OK, quality of the product."
The battery's dropping fast. The battery's not 100%.
It's okay to try it first. I don't know if it's sustainable.
"The sound is small, the waves are short on both sides as they grow, they're unstable, they lose what they're using even though they're not much higher than the price."
"Quick delivery, sound good."
"If you don't answer the order, you won't be able to answer it, so you don't know what's going on."
Yeah.
"The second time, it's still a mistake."
There's no earpiece inside the island.
shippe's got a heart and a movement fast but it sounds like it's slower than the movie.
"Let's use it. It's okay. It's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good."
"You can only hear one side, and if you're in this situation, you'll pay for it."
"About charging the battery with kilograms, taking 72% of headsets down to 59%. Now charge is going to be 59% higher."
"80 percent of the charge goes on and on, and I can't figure it out, and I can't feel it, and I can't feel it, and I can't feel it, and I can't feel it."
Hand over distorted boxes both on the outside and the ear can't hear one side.
"Don't know what product and quality comes after ntn, recommended 4*"
"It's a good price, but I've got a lot of shit to buy, and I've got a good idea who'll show it to my friends."
"It's cheap, the battery's okay, the price's right."
The delivery is fast and the battery's dropping too fast... doubting its quality.
"Sells an earpiece that can't be charged, puts it in charge, says it's charging, but doesn't go into the battery."
Listen to sound playing video games while listening to music. Okay.
The hearing ear can't connect. It only listens to one side.
"Listen to feel very now very ok, but don't know what time it's going to be later on"
"just how to connect to the shop. Oh, my God. Oh, my God."
It's not charged by one ear after two days.
"Poor quality, a quick headset."
The number of batteries is very short.
"It's not good, it's five minutes out of battery, or else the battery's out."
A two-and-a-half' earpiece is a dead connection.
"I just bought it. It's not like the description, it's broken on one hand."
Too bad one side of you is deaf.
"I'm getting back a star because I've just bought it, and I'm sure there's something incomplete going on."
Fine.
"Good sound, carefully packed."
"If you don't use it, it'll be dead by itself."
I don't know if I'll ever be able to pay for it.
What's wrong with buying a box that doesn't have one of these things in a box that doesn't have a hand?
"It's all over, it's a broken ear, it's okay to use one ear, it's good to wear both ears."
"It's a good quality to check later, 1/6 for 4 stars."
I don't know what you're talking about. I don't know what you're talking about. I don't know what you're talking about. I don't know what you're talking about.
It doesn't sound good. It doesn't sound good.
"The ear listens to the big side, and as you're listening, you're getting tawed too."
The battery's been used or something. It's too bad.
"It's okay, it's a little late, it's okay, but if that's a good thing, then it's a good thing."
"Bad conversation, bad hearing."
"The battery doesn't know what it's like yet, but it's kind of happy, but it's not going to be able to make it sound and it's not going to be negative, so it's not going to stabilize the transmission."

"The product runs out of batteries, the quality of sound is only stable, and generally it's not the same as the manufacturer's criteria."
"I'm going to have an earful, and I'm going to make sure my shop's ready."
The first two days are good. How can you charge these days and your ear doesn't go into your battery? Even though the glass is full of batteries.
It's impossible to connect even to lift one ear.
It doesn't sound like anything to me. It's a bad product.
"Not satisfied with products, nor with manner of service."
"The package's been received. Okay, but the battery's not ready yet. Okay."

"The total disappointment of buying again and again about plugging, using the right day is broken, plugging into the computer, not seeing the device, trying all the web gates, setting up the entire win seven, even though win 10."

"The device is not received, the device is not allowed. Please change the device immediately."
"Fast delivery, well packed, but when connected in the same room, less than five meters apart, but listening to music, it doesn't feel smooth."
"It's kind of black, the first time I've set up tikis that fail, webs that don't work, installed from the home page even though the win 10, *** on both lap and pc didn't work."
"Thank you Tiki for delivering the product carefully and on time. My computer is using window 7, so I've installed more ioslave based on instructions. However, I can't connect to any device with a PCB around it like a phone, an earpiece. The error report is csbport_enmmerated_00 failed. I want to return this product."
"It's probably only good for mice, ears are bad, it's hard to connect, it's unstable, it's good to switch to other companies. You consider it before you buy it."
"The product looks exactly like the image. The whole company. I put it in a cpu so that I could connect the blues to the ear, and she'd explode. She was sitting less than a meter away, and the signal was weak, bored."

"Win 10 good support, plug in and receive it right away. However, once you're connected to an earpiece, there's a shock rate, the reason you're connected to keyboards and mice at the same time. After unpair mouse and keyboard, you're OK."
My computer's connected to the speaker but no music. I'm connected to the phone. Okay.
"It's not good to use it, it's possible that my device is full of phase five so it's not good for me."
"Your computer win 10, you can plug it in, you don't need to install a mouse and an earpiece fast, you can't get disconnected, you can't get a TPlink product, you can trust it, you don't know how long it's going to last, you don't know how long it's going to last."

Mouse has a good material, and is fully refined. During use has failed three times, but is still good, and is still useful, almost not a scratch or a problem.

"The Wireless Mouse M185 sold in Tiki is a quality, advanced product. I use it entirely smooth whether it's wood surface or paper. The soft and extremely sensitive button, the smooth scroll button. I particularly like the mouse plug-in and forgetfulness function, because I just have to plug the nano head into the USB port, without any need to draw in, without fear of losing because the mouse has an open button. Pin is used well. Pin is delivered by Tikii primed, unremovable, unmoded, with full security labels."

"The mouse is now mostly branded or produced in China, so it's very difficult to choose. When I buy it, I tend to consider the prestige, the price, and the service that comes with the product. So I choose this mouse because I believe that Tiki is the main product."
"I put this mouse to my husband's use. <i>Good, light, good, short-hand, naughty child throws on the ground several times and still good, no problem.</i> <i>Thank you.</i> <i>Thank you very much.</i> <i>Thank you very much.</i> <i>Thank you very much.</i> <i>Thank you very much.</i> <i>It's very reasonable.</i> <i>It's very reasonable.</i> <i>It's very good.</i> <i>It's very good.</i> <i>It's very good.</i>"
I can use it. I feel like I've had better days than this one.
"Poor quality, no money, shouldn't buy this product."
"Quick delivery, quality, carefully packed."
No problem at all.
That's good. That's good. That's good.
"If you're an office member, you buy this product very well -- it's a good touch, it's a good grip, it's a long-term battery, and if you drop it, it doesn't break or break anything."
It's like a mouse's foot.
"Sensitive, running well, tiki delivery fast, satisfied"
Row OK
"Two longs, two longs, two longs. I bought them."
"It's slow, it's not sensitive."
"This is a good product for even those of you who make many mouse-use designs, spend about two years at a high rate."
It's okay to use it. It's better to improve. Different care is okay. It's a little slow.
"Anyway, we're using the M325 to try M185 to see what it's like, to tear down the mouse. It's like, ""Oh, my gosh, I don't know how to describe it."""
"Rats run fine, but sometimes they're stuck, blue doesn't look like pictures."
"I have ordered this mouse from Tiki on Thursday, July 31, 2014, and I don't think the afternoon is still working because I've only recently known Tiki and Tiki's staff have called to confirm, which is a very polite and professional way, and the person who has an appointment about the next week, but only after two days."
"Used to be M175, after two years of breaking into M185, talking about office computer mice, the Voltatech line is the best option."
"Let me ask you the bottom part of the klick mouse when I turn on On there's a light on. The situation is that the mouse was just bought, but the lights were on."
"It's very sensitive, it's just a touch, it's a pleasure, it's more Taki's choice, it's more loving."
"I've ordered this mouse from Tiki and I've been using this mouse for about a week. I'm very pleased with this product. The product responds to my needs.: a mouse has basic, neat and light functions, which is easy to move along with a laptop. Besides, the mouse is very easy to install and operate. When I receive a package, the mouse is carefully wrapped in a paper box with a new package to avoid collision. The whole package, the whole package, originally, there's no trace from before me that I feel very quiet."
"Light mouse, neat operation, steady blues deliver quickly"
2 months is still good. Deal with the package and fast transport.
One week I saw a mouse using okie.
Good Use
I've been using this mouse for over a year and I've been using it for more than a year.
"The first thing when I chose this mouse because I saw it with a pinatatech label, and the other thing that made me a little bit more secure about the quality of the product is that the maintenance date for 36 months, and it took a while for me to see that the mouse that was in my hand was pretty small and right with the people whose hands were on the other side, and it's been taking more than six months and I haven't changed any batteries, and it's a good product that comes from a brand name."
"A relatively cheap price for a high-intensive mouse. Simple, easy-to-use design, with a low-strike tip on the middle of the body, gives a nice bit of comfort. The lower design doesn't really work very well, if it's not easy to use on flat surface, but it's not really good enough. The mouse narrowness is still quite rough with high friction, but it's not too smooth, and it's not very steady, and it's still pretty sensitive, and it's still pretty sensitive."
"Thank you, tiki."
Thank you.
Good.
"Fast delivery, good connection, good form"
"SP's a big deal, soft price, nice package, standard delivery unit."
Transmission and hyper-good connection

It's too short for a two-metre recording wire.
"It's incredibly satisfying, so it's always up here to write to the brothers, and when it comes to delivery, it's on Sunday morning, it's already there, in general, that TIVI's speed is always impressive. The keyboard is well wrapped up, it's packaged, it's nice -- it's right, it's right, it's right, it's good -- it's good -- it's good -- it's good -- it's good -- it's good for people who want to read text -- it, it's like you'll probably lose it, but it's okay."
"The delivery is fast, the package is a little bit worn in two angles, but this one is hard to avoid, and in the product experience, I've got all the keys I've got, some 2 keys, three key combinations are basically normal."
"Dealing with the order and packing carefully (which may be the result of your advance payment) the smooth - tempered keyboard must be both consistent with soft, stable work compared to the cost of money, hoping for good endurance."
"Quick delivery. If everyone understands that we've come to life, it's to carry on with us the responsibility of building a better life, and then we're going to enjoy the happiness of philosophy together, then the Earth will continue to revolve around the sun forever, and unfortunately few of us remind us of this, so we're lost, and we're lost, and we're just going to find our first enjoyment, and we're going to live irresponsible."
I can't believe Tiki delivered so fast that I can't believe it.
"The good product, fast delivery, so far there's no complaints about this keyboard, but the hard key is probably not much, so the keyboard isn't soft."
"There's a digital keyboard that should be very convenient for the calculation input operation. The price is cheap compared to the quality. The base key, easy to use. The key is a little loud but very sensitive."
"It's good, it's packed, it's delivered fast, it's tough to see."
"Today, travel is becoming a new way of life, and travel is not just tourism, but it's about exploring, experiencing, not just listening to the lecturer, but it's got to be involved, it's about interacting, it's about interacting with each other, it's about finding a new kind of travel -- it's about traveling responsibility -- it's about what it's called -- it's about the kind of travel that comes from individual behavior and responsibility, it's about organizing, it's about natural and social environment, it's about putting specific demands on the side of travel."
"The product is packed carefully, Shipper is committed, the quality of the product is good because it's used, so it's bought more."
"It's light, it's cheap, it's got a web, it's got an onl, it's got a typewriter that's OK, it's all the tiki trade. It's too fast. Now, but 24 hours is what you get."
"The delivery's too fast, friendly delivery workers, quiet typing keyboards, easy to move, very cute little design."
"Use it well, tikinow is super fast for an hour. it's cheaper than any other place."
"I know Tiki's got a very good delivery service, but this time really quickly, our home in the Middle East ordered the order for at least three days that this one has a new set of days."
"Nice keyboard, good quality for the price, good enough for the need, better than a 500-k-o-t-t-t-o-t-t-t-o-t-t-o-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-o-t-t-t-t-t-o-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t."

"New product, the company itself, full of accessories, quick delivery, appointment, enthusiastic delivery attitude."
Okay.
"I've been using anti-burners for three months and the key is still new, the short key journey is easy to type, it doesn't work very well for the game, the stress of the SPHM key is also very strong: it's weak, it's loose. This one's too priced, it's okay, there's no more demand, it's saving money for Cosair k70 low profile."
"Be careful with the package delivery, except the delivery time can't go any faster:"
"The keyboard is so small, it's simply not necessary because the demand is to type, it's pretty well packed, it's actually resuscitated and then it's not alive, and then it's a keyboard, and it's always worth a lot more than the outside purchase."
Tiki delivers quickly! <i>The buttons when the feeling is loose but yet sensitive and the response is dark.</i> <i> Use the office well to type text!</i>
That's what I'm talking about. That's what I'm talking about. That's what I'm talking about. That's what I'm talking about.
"Friendly shipper, well-packed, sure, smooth keyboard,"
"It's the company that's cool. It's the right choice to buy a brother. It's for people who've beaten coffee off the table, the quality of speed delivery, the kind of trade that's too prestigious."
"Okay, the package is exactly what it looks like, it hasn't been experienced long enough, so we don't have any more information."
"Because of the small amount of money, which is also the lowest, but also the lowest quality at such a price. 1; the soft, light keyboard key: very easy to hit, not hard, but also small noise; and while in general the type is very smooth; the shape, the size: fit, not too large, not too light; the keyboard has a certain level of smoothness; it looks very generally, it's all good to look at."
"The product, as it seems, the delivery is fast, the typing keyboard is good, the package is tight, it's wonderful."
Keyboard's fine at price range.
"I don't know if it's okay to play games. The backspace button has to press twice to work, whether it's the keyboard or it's the same thing."
"Deal with the package and the package carefully, the smooth keyboard must fit into the light office job"
"The nice keyboard used to be, and the price was too much nuts, and the log line was gone."
"It's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's bad, it's bad."
"Since you're in a hurry to deliver something fast, it's important that the price be right."
The real soft table.
"Although the keyboard is a bit large, it doesn't fit, it doesn't type well, it makes up for sensitive keys, it doesn't tire out, it's too good, it's very good for the people in the office, it's worth buying."
"Send the correct package, use it well, press light and smooth"
Good keyboard. I just got it. I'm gonna try it now.
"The keyboard is a little small but has the pole, the key that makes sense pretty good, and it's appropriate for you to buy learning and work, and it's fun in a simple direction (this isn't a row, so don't ask for too high)."
"The package is carefully packed. The signatures on the large and light keyboard are visible. The long string is convenient. The package has been received, so this is the only observation."
It's the best nuts on the floor. It's the best. It's gonna be delivered tomorrow night. It's gonna be great.
"That's the perfect tiki, quality off the delivery now, very quickly. Ten points."
"Using a week and seeing no problem, the key is slightly loose, probably because the key is long but the leg is just as small as the other keys. The keyboard is suitable for the office."
"Good, nice keyboard, careful packaged Tiki"
"The package is thorough, the delivery is fast, the keyboard is smooth, the connection is easy"

"This keypad is very sustainable. I've been using this keyboard for almost five years. Now I've just ordered a new one. The priority is bold and easy to see. If I don't go along with fashion, this keyboard will be good for the office."
"It's DIGWORD's company, the product's still intact, it's a bit packed up, but it's a fast delivery, and by the way, it's worth money for rice."
"Good keyboards, it's a little long, it's not convenient to carry them with them."
"The product is, like, cheap, beautiful, very quick to deliver, very pleased with the work of Logotech, which says 50 characters, and nothing else, so if you have doubts, you buy it, okay?"
Tikinow is worth a lot of money.
"The Oke key, as soon as it's two hours of delivery, no more OTP code has been delivered to your address, so there's a front line that's not received, there's no code, so we have to wait for delivery twice!"

"The hierarchy keyboard, however, does not find the draining hole in the description of the product."
"At this price, it's completely satisfied with keyboard quality, keyboard swings, smoothness, packing, and transportation."
"The design's fine, the quality's good for the price, the knots are smooth, the product's exactly what it looks like."
"The typing keyboard is really good, and at this price, there's no competition."
Keyboard OK
"The sensor key, which can be typed fast and unlocked."
Sp is carefully packed in carton boxes.
"Price brands are good, thin, but sure, easy to use."
"Quick delivery, this afternoon, pick-up, three-year warranty, and that's a hell of a lot of money."
"It's cheaper, but it's better than a lot of bell keyboards at the same price."
"Knock it off, the company's front line, pack it carefully, get a reasonable price."
"The delivery is fast, the product is good, it's very pleased with tiki's services."
"keyboards have good wires, tenacity, good typing keys, basic needs."
"We've been using it for a month, which is good for average prices."
Logotech is good.
"The nice ones don't scratch, but they don't have a hint of how hard they're going to use them for a certain amount of time. For this price they're quite satisfied. So let's try it out for a month, let's say the ae when you're using the product should also make sure the next person buys an objective view of the product. Thank you, tiki."
"This rubber keyboard is very basic for typing text and... reluctant to play games. However, it is impossible to expect such a thing as with a muscle keyboard. Pack it up, complete it. Buy only because the F-keys on your laptop have to press Fn_T."
"In the company that was also using this kayak, it's also appropriate to buy another used at home, very different quality, very uncomfortable perch, and I seriously doubt the quality of Tiki Trading's product."
"It's a little loud at night, it's good at a price, it's a long shot, it's a long shot, it's a little bit more time to use it, it's a little harder to buy two, because the dealer doesn't sell one."
"One question is, sees the maintenance description of the 36-month product (when you're buying the tiki polling), and you get the product, and you don't see the warranty, and on the product there's no band, and you don't know where to put it, if you don't have any problems with the product, can Tiki answer?"
"The basic keyboard, a good light, smooth key. The person who likes a silence keyboard chooses something else. I'm satisfied with this keyboard. A soft touch on behalf of the old keyboard doesn't eat the key anymore."
"It's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good."
The good stuff for the two stars the delivery guy gave me back the good stuff and it's hard to blame Mk like the Mk's taking the time to deliver it at the same time he came home from school.
"It's super fast, it's been booked last night, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's bad, it's bad, it's bad, it's bad, it's bad, it's bad."
"New stuff, sure, but the connection sucks."
Fast deliver - light key but failed to press key 2 3 moving buttons (in game fifa) long suffered a very well -
"Thanks to the receiver and the delivery staff, they've got more money than they've got."
"The design key is very poor. As many of you say, the press is like non-clicking. It doesn't make noise. However, the time key I think is going to fail quickly. It's much weaker than any other key."
"The price is good, the whole package, the quality product, the feel of pressing the key very much, but the delivery is a little late."
The product probably doesn't fit our computer so the keyboard doesn't work.
"The keypad received on Monday, but in about 15 minutes it takes a connection to restart the computer to reuse it."
"INTERNATION OF BDS # VLAND MONTHS INTERNATIONAL VP: 75 14th Street, Lucky, Q9, HCMC"
"It's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's time to answer."
"Nice form, bought for you, so you don't know what the quality is."
"I don't know if it's the computer or the keyboard, and sometimes when you put it up, the keyboard's got to pull back and forth."
"The quick delivery, the product that looks like a description, and Tiki's dropping off the 50-char entry, and it's just too annoying to judge, but CH Play isn't even this much."
"The keyboard's rough, but the keyboard's hard-core, the delivery's a big deal, it's a temporary evaluation because it's only been tried for four stars."
"Quick delivery, carefully packed goods of the same kind"
"The keyboard is good, hard, but the key is deep, but it also emits sounds, even though it's a little smaller than the average keyboard."
"The product is really bad, pressing key combinations at no time, using it for work that's really repressive."
"The keyboard is soft, typing feels a little slow."
keyboard games failed to press more than one button at a time.
"Spending more than a month feels a bit stiff, still good at the price."
"The product's fine, the sensor key, there's a tiny subtraction point, it's a little bit small, and it's not familiar, but it doesn't matter who's used to using a keyboard on the laptop."
"It's cheap, it's okay, the keyboard's a little hard, so there's a lot of typing going on, and I don't have a lot of need to type, so I'm happy to buy this: D."
"Sensitive, slightly gentle, but a little loud. If there's a mini-mpad, it's better if it's not a numpad."
"The beautiful design keyboard, the corner tips and cuts most of the subservients outside the keyboard. The button is quite low, the fine and light pop, with a few people they may not like this very much. The Enter key is quite small but makes up for the Space key (which looks or also called that long key) is difficult and has a charm effect. A Povraytech brand is also very well known for external devices such as mice and keys, so you shouldn't worry much about the brand name of the product."
"Tiki delivers fast, small keyboards, good quality, myself primarily against text, feeling very pleased."
"But in terms of office tasks, you have a need to play games that you shouldn't buy, because you can only press four keys at the same time."
Be careful with the good stuff.
"Long delivery, keyboard play. Okay, the key's a little hard."
"IT'S THE FIVORITY OF THE NGON, EARTH, OBJECTION OF A ENJECT TIME."
"Logitech is still a prestigious brand, the integrity of the product is relatively good."
It's a hard key. It's not cool. I'll buy a bell next time.
"The keyboard is paralyzed by four buttons, which requires a quick payment."
It's very thick.
"The good product at a price point, the only thing I'm not happy about is buying at least two, while I just need one."
Okay.

"We can use it, we can type it."
It's a little loud.
The package is delivered super-long
Experienced product.
It's okay.
The key drive isn't very deep. The product is relatively okay within range.
Good.
"The keyboard is fine, it'll probably last a long time. The cost is cheap enough to fit the money in. The downside is a little loud when you type."
"It's important not to put it in, it doesn't matter if you don't ask for it."
"The keyboard is sensitive, the keys are OK, but the typing is very loud."
Okay. Good use.
There's nothing to hit. Two stars.
It's okay. It'll take some time to evaluate.
Why did we leave behind information that we haven't seen in almost a month?
"OK, pack your bags carefully, everyone go get them."

It's not a good time for games.
The keyboard has often lost its connection to the laptop (I use win 8.1) which is kind of annoying. It's probably just that USB connections are unstable.

"Use good, sensitive welltttttttttttt"

"buy it because many of the day-to-day mouse guards are like loggg102, high perfection. However: The mouse body is quite slippery; the mouse moves a little bit, and it's a masquerading jump (lift off?) the mouse’s body doesn't create quite a long-term comfort (before I use g102 all day 12-14 hours)."
"For May, you've been buying for the goods since March."
"Fast delivery, put in less than a day already. <i>Mouses ranging both sides of the web.</i> <i>Good.</i> <i>But I bought 8.6.2020.</i> <i>and it was April, 2 months of maintenance.</i> <i>I hope that tiki settled it early.</i>"
The delivery's too slow. It's delivered in two or three hours. It's four days from now.
"The ship's rat, bought it for a month, sometimes used it, and double-clicked it."
Get the mouse at noon when the mouse is not sensitive. Ask the store for a store
The delivery's 10 days longer than the delivery.
The mouse bought it with a scratch on the base of the foot. The clicks on both sides don't sound so good.
"That's a good mouse, and DPI's too low."
Okay.
Oke sp long delivered package sure
"M wrote wrong so he didn't get the package, maybe the shop delivered the wrong person, it's your fault anyway."
"Fast delivery, nice mice, light clicks, jumps, but the feeling of a rat is not very smooth."
It'll take me three months to check the warranty stamps. I hope tiki solves the case.
For a while there's double clicks.
"Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on."

"The same product in the picture, beautiful color, soft, outside plastic inside of the metal, which looks solid and strong sound sounds good, connecting the Bluetooth with speed, with lap top less than one beat, but still okla, the connection to the lap is fine, transmission is fine."
"That's a nice earpiece. The bass sounds good. The battery's pretty good. Okay, so buy it."

"headsets are good, good."
Okay.
Good.
"And there's a couple of places in the picture that don't have anything to do with it: (exquisitely, it's all right with the bass, it's okay with taking the bass to the airport, it's a six-tenth of noise, it's a good bluet; it's a good bluet; it's not possible to connect both the computer and the computer at the same time.)"
"The Trebles is very bright, 500k but the sound is much worse than Beat Studio 3 is 250k, the only thing you can find is a three-and-a-half circuit reading five stars that don't look good."
"I've been using it less than a month, and my headset's broken, even though it's outside normal. It's beautiful, but it's pretty murky, especially if I can't connect with Macbook M1."
"The description comes from Vietnam, but the reality is that China, because it wants to support the Vietnamese, but it's China again, so it's a little bit disappointing to edit its origin and add a microSD charge, not typeC."
We can't even hear through the earpieces.
"Use obsolete charging ports, this is an existing package"
"The sound's fine, but the wire's a little short, the wire's a little bit shorter, if it's a little longer, fine."
"It's deaf listening ae, so don't get your hopes up."
"Take advantage of your laptop and phone, don't cause ear pain, long-term use, eliminate pretty good noise."
"It's all over the place, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's done, it's done, it's done, it's done, it's done, it's done, it's done, it's done, it's done, it's done, it's done, it's done, it's done, it's done."
Bass is squeamish. His charged leg hasn't been charged in a month.
The line's fine. The button's a little loose.
"I can't get through to the phone, please send me the back-up number of the shop I'm in touch with."
It's only been three months that I've been too shy to talk about.
"Listen to the music, it's beautiful."
"Headsets. Okay, sometimes interference has to be turned on again. There's a small delay."
"If you really want to feel music, you shouldn't buy it."
"Nice, sound good."
"Nice ear, fastship."
The voice of the bass is timid: ((real disappointments really)
"The sound's fine, it's not as good as the price."
"The sound sounds pretty good, the bass sounds good."
It still sounds a little delayed.
It's normal.
"Listen to the sound of people who speak differently, sound is fine."
It's okay. It's okay.
"It's beautiful, it sounds clear, it's pretty good."
The bass wasn't what it was supposed to be.
Fine.
Okay.
Good.

"Shipper delivers fast, well-finished, not used. Hopefully, it's good."
"Good stuff, quick charge, quick delivery, well packed."
Beautiful little charge.
Use it well at the current price.
"The package goes back quickly, the pattern guarantees, the charge is untested, so we don't know what the results should be, so we don't know, we should evaluate four, take some time if we're all set up."
"Name sp IP14 and only someone with an iPhone who thinks it's for iPhones, and I'm going to type C because I think it's a normal charge, I don't know if I can get paid, but I can't use a type C, too disappointed."
"The charges aren't as fast as 20 watts, there's a sound charge, there's a noise."
It's too hard for each other to make a mistake.
"It's a little light, it's probably cheap."
"Be careful with packages, and good use will support"
Take it from an hour and 30 minutes.
Fast delily good
Please.
It's too small to match the pattern.
"The mouse is 6 feet tall and 6 feet tall, and the plastic feels good, the actual appearance is better than the home page."
The woman's hands are small but the large mouse will hold her hand better than the others. Pressing super smooth and sensitive. Be Edit button at will. Quality 5* is better than the price of money
Good.
"Mouse is smooth, smooth, and right-handed, for sure, the key is silky, doesn't sound like an M557. Supporting both types of communication should be very comfortable in exchange for applications."
"Good mouse, shorthand handle, fast connection"
"The key to total silence, the wheel is smooth, the mouse is quite thick, so it holds the hand as well."
"Use it well, smooth, smooth press, smooth scroll button, but the rubber class will soon be aging like any other Gabon mouse."
"Rats are so smooth, sometimes I'm afraid of spraying, so I have to press a few times."
"The mouse is smooth, the click is not sound, and it's easy to handle without any help."
"The rat is good, the price is good, the log line's good for the office, and there's really nothing to talk about."
Rats worth money. Sensible. Press keys. Rats are smooth. Magic mouse 2 is just worth wearing shoes.
"Very good, very sensitive and very sustainable, I accidentally dropped it from three feet above it twice and it didn't hurt!"
"It's good. It's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good."

Smooth moving mouse
It's the fast delivery. It's the company that works.
Fine mouse
Good use.
The mouse is smooth with your hand. There is a Bluetooth connection. The large mouse Size should grip the wrist. S/N of the mouse and on the label are different? The underwear under the mouse does not appear to be as new as it seems. The signal has moved much mouse.

"My hand is equal to three ATM cards, but L size is still a little big."
"It's a little bigger than the hand, the feeling of being a little stuck and tired of hands."
"Every time you switch from blues to web gigabytes, you have to forget your phaser device to connect it."
"One product changes four times, three months fails once, a year out from the day of the purchase, never buys from Tiki again."
"The grip and click are not comfortable, and I don't feel like it's worth it."
"The long-term connection was shocked, tried to plug in another one, but still. The MJK bought it two months ago and used it normally."
"I bought it for a month, didn't crash, the mouse rolled in with a problem, it felt stuck and twisted, it didn't work."
"It's good, but it's wrong to choose the size."
The delivery is on time.
The sense of holding hands is strong.
"Okay, man."
"It's just holding on tight, it's really holding on tight. It's like, if it falls off, it's no big deal. vote 5*"
"The Ankers should be okay, holding the machine, dust won't come in, black and white, but the carbon-based balls look nice."
It's genuine. It's thick.

"Nice model, long-term, low-intensive scarring. Very fine."
Okay.
"It's been a while, it's been a long time, it's tough and sure, looks a little rough, like superman, but I like it."
"It's hard, but it's easy to get into the phone, and the quality is good, so there's no extra plastic on the side, and it's good to have a handle, and it's a little heavy."
Quality Completed
"Fast delivery, the exact product described"
"It's a beautiful product, it's just my phone."
It's too good for the price.
It's a smooth hug.
"I can't even touch the screen on the ground with the edge of the machine, how long it'll be as new as new, and I'd say it's too expensive."
"It's good, it's used since it's been bought, it's made more heavy, it's worse: it's consistent with boys!"
It's very nice. It's very beautiful. It's okay. I'm normal.
Nice quick delivery.
Good stuff shipper has a mind.
That's right. That's the description.
"It's a good feature, it's good shock control, it's a good alternative to Spigen's back."
That's great.
"It's standard, it's nice, it's the company, it's holding its back, it's light buttons, but it's a little slippery, but it's a good shock."
"It's nice, it's tight. It's heavy, but it's really strong."
"Very pleased with the product, for the 5-star shop!"

"It's been a week, it's been nice, it's a little rough, it's okay, but for this plastic part, it's bad, it's not as bad as Nillkin defender when it comes to hard objects, and it's generally because there's no longer anaphylaxis for 7phlus 8plus, but I'm still hoping that Nillkin defender or UAG has a sample for old iiphones."
"Perfection is good, it's tight, it's beautiful."
"I got it on August 29,230, on the box with the SX stamp on it, 2019, and I don't know if SX's had much effect on SP's life expectancy, but at a price of more than 40K, it's okay."
Shop sent the wrong size for the repair shop
"The back of the camera is good, but the part that comes up to protect the screen is not as high as the illustration of the product, and the food is so small, if the phone falls upside down it's probably going to be able to protect the screen."
"The good product, cloud protection, which you buy for a long time, will make the machine bigger in size, so it's a little uncomfortable to take out the pocket or use it, but it's a protection, so you have to be understanding."
"Old delivery, much scratched, the seal's been removed."
"The package's fine, but the envelope looks pretty old, seal's kind of unsealed and re-sealed, and the inside product's full of stains that show that the product has been seal-used and used before, maybe just ***-- the whole thing is okay with users as easy as it is."
Good.
"Rows received, although sealed, were scratched and worn."
"Tiki trust, when you open the box, you can't see your back, can't be disappointed."
Just fit and quality.
That's right.
"It's good, it's hard, it's bad, it's bad."
"It's the exact same product, but it's a pretty old box and a lot of scratch, except for one star."
"It's too rough. Put it in an iphone. Look like a slipper. If it falls, it doesn't fall."
It's a one-time commercial. It's not like a commercial.
"Quick hit, quick exchange shop for yourself"

Okay.
"It's okay, but the charge's normal."
"We've got the charge, we've got the quick delivery, we love Tiki."

"The price for beautiful, sure, easy to move, package carefully delivers fast and friendly"
"Ten points, a total of weight for nearly four kilograms, which is still smooth, and a different print case shell that thinks it's mixed up and it's still the right product."
"The good product, sure, the turnout mechanism is light."
"Great quality, about to buy a couple dozen more for the employees in the company."
"It's good to buy a book, it's too bad, it's too convenient to write a book, it's too convenient to design, it's too convenient to write a book."
The beauty of the product seems to be tough.
"Nice, sure, packed carefully, delivered quickly."
"The box to take away is pretty silly, thinking whether to add a button to lock up the product."
"The second buy has been SHOP, which doesn't have to be adjusted - the price's a bit high!"
"It's beautiful, it's tough, it's neat, it's advanced."

Very sure and beautiful.
It's OK and it's beautiful.
"It's really good, but I've got a really long scratch on it, and I've got the video, but I don't need to change it because I've already given it to my girlfriend."
"But I can't handle the weight of 10 kilograms with the Macbook Pro 16 inch, and the price can't hold, and there's an phenomenon that's falling out the back."
Sure; the utility to meet the need for transportation is easy.
It's okay.
Get the goods. Not used to...
"Not to mention the ability to charge inside, but just looking at the outside has seen this very fast cable Type C to Lightning, which is extremely strong, tenacious and, of course, without the luxury, the Instruments are perfected by high-level aluminum compound material that is able to wear out, which is good against oxygenation, which prevents the rust that has been used over long periods of time."
"There's something I'm wrong with, I don't know what's on both ends is type C, so I can't use the backup charge at home."
"Fast delivery, packaged goods, fabric cable shells, no loose ends, no satisfaction."
"The wire looks soft, the feeling is strong, the two small ends are in relative strength, the charge is good."
"Two lines of type C that don't have an Output type C, so we have to buy another pin, but quick charge, okay?"
"Using two days as a result: fast and fast charge, the hard wire overcomes the weakness of the traditional string, and as far as endurance takes more time to figure it out."
"The company's main product, fast delivery, new purchases, not fully evaluated, the coin is the main one. Thank you for joining us."
Can you change my product?
"Hard-loaded, tight-knited, hard-wired wire transfers full capacity, hopefully long-term."

"Putting a quick delivery during the day and delivery shop (C to Lightning), when requests were made to change and delivered in the morning, the store reported all the items outside HN, so it didn't work out, which means that the shop was wrong, but it still involved the client's experience and time, so before I bought it, I had to run out and buy it to get what I could use and pay the money back."
"Fast delivery, good use, but each one's a little short, and if it's about two meters long, it's better."
Set type c out of c that delivers web out type c
"The charge cable is good for fast charge, neat form."
Phone charge won't come up.
"It's on the device, it's quick, it's tight, it's tight, it's good, it's good to buy."
"It's okay with the description, so buy the product."

"Very oke, 98/100 points no web receive"
"Right description, quality product."
Okay.
"Look at the neat little outside fit who has the fast delivery hand Tiki, but it's a bit disappointed, but there's no shocker."
Can you ask if this mouse needs to be attached to the computer? I don't see any room near the battery?
I got an open package that found the device missing the computer connection device.
I can get it on my laptop. I just bought it. I don't know what I'm gonna order.
"Bad product, used so far, left mouse clicked not back"
There's no flash drive inside the mouse?
KThere is a mouse connection with pc
"Rats don't have webs on their laptops, mice are used very well."
"Lighter, fast-wired, unresolved phasers, shut-down web necks, charge over usbs, not battery replacements, with rat poison buttons, good for the price."
"Package carefully, quickly delivered, the cskh side is eager to settle when the mouse is wrong, thank you shop"
"It's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good."
"I like black all black. Sorry, miss, how do you get usb?"
"The low cost of high quality, will support the store with more products."
"Sensitive di, battery's been on for a long time. It's okay, it's nice."
"It's beautiful. It's nice to cover up a layer of top face. It's not scary, it's very nice."
The message from the shop to Mr. shipper is lovely.
"It's smooth, it's exactly the way it looks, but it's going to take time."
"You can charge the laptop again, which is convenient, which is good."
"Rats are so small, they're so beautiful, they're worth it."
Good product.
"Good connection, smooth press"
"It's nice and it's okay, it's not as loud as a rumor."
It's beautiful. It's very smooth.
It's kind of hard to use.
Pleased with the product and the cskh of the shop very well
"Thank you for your quality product, for your 5-star shop."

"I get the product that's an old product that's been used, a scratch and a stain."
It's a very slow hit. It's almost as slow as you can get and you can use it.
"Rats don't run, they don't work, they don't start."
We're good. We're good. We're good.
"Rats are fine, a little bit lag, the charge line is not charged."
She's beautiful. She's got her hands on her hands.
Good quick delivery friendly
"A steady connection, high quality goods, super fast delivery Shop."
"Well, if you're wrong, you'll see later."
"Connection, temperature, stability, speed delivery, all good."
"Good connections, good price good good goods"
Good.
Use ok
Cool.
"The RJ45 we think is 1,000 milligrams, but it's only 100 milligrams..."
Okay.
"You know, it's better to take a little bit of pressure and look at the big stuff. I bought my girlfriend, and she liked it."
"It's brand new, but it's a bit of a trick, pick up the rope, charge it when it doesn't, it's more likely that it's a no-rope charge mode, it's a nice color."
"Good package, full accessories, short ranges of bass orientation, low-term batteries, low-sharp and earaches, low-to- 700K levels of satisfaction."
"We've got a little bit of cohesion, but it's okay, the delivery's pretty fast, the ear's holding its head as well as the ears, and for me, it's pretty good, it's a little bit of bassy, Bluetooh's stable, and it's pretty good, so I've got the right drift, so I don't know what the battery should be, so I don't know what the battery should be doing."
"The buttons on the earpiece are a little loose, but the quality of sound is good. The battery's not down for two hours. It's pretty comfortable."
"I've already used one before, which is quite sustainable, and I've got about 12 to 18 hours per charge per person."
"I've spent almost two years, I don't use it very often, I've seen it sound good, I've got my ears tickled, and it's just that when I put on my headset, the volume of my hearing is a little bit uncomfortable because the tone is so loud, and when I connect it to the network, it's a little slower."
"The earpiece has good sound quality, doesn't get shy when it's loud, the ears are soft, they wear long, they don't cause pain, the Bluetooth works well, they're worth the product."
"The great product, which is less than 24 hours fast, is quite a pleasure, and in general, I think people should buy it at a much cheaper time."
"Sound is clear, bass is very good at hearing bolero songs to the roof, and it's pretty sure, but my ears are big, so I have to take them off for a while, but it's a bit of an earache."
"The product is small, the plastic is not hard-wired, so it should be gentle when it's used, and the light is distorted from the hole, and the grabs on the ear, and it's smooth, and it's good."
"After about two months of use, you can't use any more. First month, your headset's fine, then you start to have these sly sounds that affect how you learn zoom and you can't listen or talk. You should consider it."
"It's good quality at the price range, but it's got a scratch on my right ear at the ""R"", which is good, thank you, shop, fast delivery. I love the way the shop works."
"It's delicious at a price, light on your ears, reasonable."
"The connection sounds are sometimes broken, and then the flash is broken, but I'm kind of wired mostly to my laptop, so I'm okay with it."
"After the reaction to the product has failed, get it back within five days!"
"Sound clear, noise resistance is good, so let's put 50 percent volume if we don't want to be outside to hear what we're hearing."
"So great at the price, shipper is so passionate, the product like the description, the sound is sound at a price, the stable connection that's worth buying."
"We've just received a product that hasn't been experienced, but we're still giving five stars because the design and the negative and also the tiki package is so good."
It's very bad. I'll use my ears for a few months.
"Sound sounds good, noise resistance is a little low, but okay within the price range."
"Fast delivery, super packed, wrapped box, full stamp, agreed to the price of the money."
"Main product, quick delivery, sound quality for the price."
"Warp delivery, it's a good deal compared to the price."
Sp is pretty sure the batteries sound good bass pleasant for whoever likes to listen to the house house lak
"Good sound, long-term batteries, convenient transportation."
Good sound hearing sounds good or not loud or because your ears are deaf you don't know and everything's fine
"Let's use the wire. Okay, let's make it easy, let's put it down, let's do it for a little bit."
"Nice headset, sounds good at the price range, thanks to the shop."
"Well, use it well. Sometimes you can still use your ears with a few squeamish noises."
The quality of sound is within range.
"Sound: Bass is fine, bamboo is good, but a little soft: seven-tenths for anyone who wants to experience it."
"SP is terrible, blues earpieces that are extremely bad at connection."
"It doesn't have a earache, it sounds good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good."
Good sound. It's very convenient for the whole job to move outside without plugging in.
It's all right.
"The earpiece's very good. Okay, bass sounds great. It's a great deal of sp."
"SP is sure. I can't connect him, but I can't connect him."
"Good negative, worth the price, safe packing is very satisfying."
"It's all right, it's all right, it's just a little big and it's a little hot."
"The sound of oke Pin is pretty heavy, because the earpieces are still a little painful."
"Real goods look like commercials, good sounds, better feelings of satisfaction than ear products that cost 2.5 times more than earpieces."
"Quick delivery, quality product."
"It's a little loud on the headset, but it can hurt your ears if you don't get used to it."
"Yeah, that sounds great. I don't know what you're talking about, but I don't think it's appropriate for anyone to have a need to talk to me about it."
"If you don't want it, you should buy it."
"That's great, thank you!"
Sounds good.
Quality OK and durability must be used to find out.
"Quick delivery, audio hearing at an acceptable level."
Okay.
It's loud. It's good. The company's off the table.
"Listen to the dress, the bass's great, the product's great, so buy it, everybody."
The product's fine compared to the price.
Okay.
Very good.
Good headset. The battery's gonna last a long time.
"It's clear, it's comfortable."
"Good sound quality at a price range, hard ear pad."
"The sound is vivid, the ears are tickled, the charge is fast, and it can last a long time."
That's great.
The sound or the volume is loud and clear.
We're good. We're good. We're good.
"Loud, clear, beautiful pattern."
"Good product, good sound, just like the description."
That sounds pretty good. No strings.
It's okay. It hurts a bit if you wear it for a long time.
The product is exactly the description!
It's fine. It's worth the price.
Very good.
Very good.
"Your hands don't hold your ears, your quality's warm."
It's okay. It fits the price range.
Use it at a price range.
Very good.
It's okie.
Okay.
"Nice, good bass."
"Good stuff, quick delivery."
Good product.
Good stuff. Okay.
I'm very good at it.
Good.
Good.

"The beautiful, simple design -- the non-commissional device -- the GSI connection is sometimes short, it's also fortunate that there's a power Seux port -- the high-quality amount of battery -- the sound bass, the soundline sounds very good -- the button increases volume and muscle, seems to be loose -- the price is very fine for the product line at a price."
"Fast delivery, well packed, sounds pretty good, just a little twitchy, the mic hasn't even tried yet, but for this price, it's quite satisfying, the pads on your ears."
"It's very smooth, it's very good. It's bad Bluetooth."
"It's only taken a day and it's okay, it's pretty smooth, but it's a little light, and plastic doesn't seem too strong, so it might not last long."
"It looks good. The delivery looks good. It's fast, but I don't know if there's anything wrong with my ear. It sounds like a disk scratch, like if it's going to happen, check the ranges and obstacles, but I'm sitting right next to the laptop. The battery is 100 percent connected, not the battery is going to run out, but the battery is not going to run out."
"I've been using these two months, and I've got some insights about products: beauty, beauty, batteries that are used quite long: plastic, so it's easy to get dirty, to feel uncertain, but the most important point is that even though I keep very careful and I don't let my eyes hit, the most recent two weeks have been heard, and when I listen to music, it's not that much of a price, but it's pretty frustrating, people shouldn't have to buy, other kids who are better off."
"Advantage: Design ok, appropriate for a male. The buffalo (not 100 percent off-line) doesn't use a battery yet. The accent is good. The problem is: - So when you're wearing a hug, it's not going to hurt, it's not going to happen. - To connect with the phone, OK, if you're going to use a laptop, you're going to have to pick up the mouse or the network. - The first time you're wearing a hug, you're not going to get a good sound."
"It's a bad contrast, and it doesn't connect. It sounds like 100k to a zidliglgggl bought from two years before 500k."
"Because you can't reach hearing ears of the same kind, it's hard to carry away."
You can't just pick up the skin.
"Nice form. It's kind of awkward to fold, but it'll take a few days to figure it out."
"Asshole, mono, kilo with hifi."
"The goods, the goods, the goods, the goods, the goods, the goods, the goods, the goods, the goods, the goods, the goods, the goods, the goods, but when they hear them, they get jerked off a lot of times."
"We haven't been able to pay back yet, after we've taken care of it."
"Received and used, satisfied with the product"
"It's okay, it's not too much noise, the battery doesn't last long, we use it for about two days and we have to charge it back, the phaser connection isn't so good."
"Sound copy, long-term battery, connected wire OK, however wireless connections are sometimes sporadic"
"It's okay. The bass's a little tight, but Chandler's a little short, and he's fine with the wire."
"Sound's pretty good, bass's thick but the canary's a little thin, not sharp."
"Headsets first for a day or two, okay, now that you're a little shy, it's hard to lose sometimes, to suggest that the owner of the shop consider a different product."
"He's a little shy, and he's got a little bit of a bad catch, but he can hear it, and he's not asking for it."
"In the course of listening to music, there's a sound of volume and timidity, I haven't even turned on the max volum that I've been exposed to."
"At first it was okay, but the next day, it sounded a little shy, and it was fine."
Normal in price range.
"It doesn't sound great, but it's usually within the price range."
It's buyable. It's only been a few days since you've been using your Bluetooth.
It's okay. It's a little hot.
Very good.
The hard-eared hearing is very tight. It's a pain in the ass.
It's not very good. It's not what I expected.
"The hearing is fine, it's consistent with the price, but the microphone's not integrating, and the audio's ringy."
"I can hear you, but why don't you see the mic, so the next call's gonna be on speakerphone?"
"Yeah, I'm good. I'm good. I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good."

"It sounds good, but it's been a long time since I've been a little shy. I can't get my ears fixed."
Batteries are a little weak. They're all right.
It's been a long time since I've heard the sound.
"I bought something that asked me to export VAT bills, and I never saw the receipt coming."
"It's not great, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good to play games, it's not good to listen to music"
It's a boring ear.
A little pain in the ear.
"It's okay, it's good for price."
I can hear it. It doesn't sound good. It doesn't sound good.
"At first it's okay. Three, four days later, there's a faint noise."
"Bad product, short-term sound."
"It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay."
Sounds pretty good.
It's a little painful and it's a little hot for a long time.
It looks a little cheap.
good use
Use it. Okay. Use it long enough.
Sounds good.
I can't hear you. I can't hear you. I can't hear you.
The buffalo battery doesn't sound good.
Good at price range.
"It's the first time it's really hot, it's normal, it smells like fire."
"The package hasn't been received yet, but shiper's been informed that it's been sent."
"The clock can't be used, the shop's going to collect and they're going to call for the post office, the quality and the service are bad, and the Shop's going to force five new stars to get it back."
"I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it."
"Quick delivery, carefully packed, box intact, SD doesn't know yet."
"The price's good, but the quality's good. Your grandmother should draw it."
"The package gets the right description, pretty good, pretty fast feedback shop."
"Sound smooth touch OK, shop very carefully call ask questions."
It's very nice. Our baby loves it. It's really cool.
Sp is fine. Call me loud and clear. My baby loves it. It's the same price as the quality.
"The delivery is as fast as the wind, and the image is coin-received."
"Pack it carefully, it's a nice watch box."
This is a beautiful model where the right price must be that many people will like to buy it for you as much as they do for you.
"I'm sorry, ma'am. I'm sorry, ma'am."
"The straps are soft, they look delicious."
"Good watch, fast delivery shop, next time you'll be supporting the shop."
"The buffalo battery, the battery's good, the battery's strong."
It's expected. It's worth a reasonable price.
It's a pleasure.
"Please with sp, thanks to the installation shop"
It's a pleasure.
The price fits the quality.

Okay.
"Go, go, go!"
"Okay, I'm pleased."
Satisfaction
"The product's good, but about learning about its origin and registration, it's about direct contacting NDTL.v., a bit of trouble and trouble."
"It's pretty fast for Google-2, but it heats up the engine, delivers fast, packs well, next time we'll buy better stuff."
It's pretty good. It's a little bit better than my 20w.
"Hit it right on the second day, charge it to death."
"Early delivery, the right row, the right color, the right quality."
"Well, there's four more rubber buttons that fit everybody, but the wire seems a little thin, so we need to keep our heads down."
"I bought one with a wire to fix the fire, sometimes with a wire to lose, so I bought one with a wire in case I needed it, and all of a sudden, the sound was too good, the ear was thin, it was soft, it didn't fail, it was okay for this price."
"It sounds good, it hurts a little, it's genuine."
"I've got three days' delay running through J&T warehouses, so it's not appropriate to pick up the product."
"The sound of the ear can hear the good design, the microphone can match the sound of the call, not the sound of the professional recording, the sound of the ear, the sound of the ear, the sound of the ear, and also the sound of the step, and it's also small -- there's a two-headed warranty for different ear sizes -- and that's a great price for 150K -- Tikirship plans 16 on the 9th that we've received, so it's just too much of an eagle."
"It's okay, there's a plastic earpiece plus a pair M and a pair of T-shirts to replace, there's an English manual and an 18-month warranty from the drop date of the warehouse, there's a mic, there's a music adjustment by pressing the button on the headphones."
Sony's own.
"For me only listening to music sometimes is this earphone too OK, but the wire button is only used to turn off rather than adjust the volume."
"I'm thinking about the company's main product, the beauty, the earpiece is a little thin, the quality of sound is normal, okay, I'm good, I'm good at this price, I'm buying the once-in-a-life and the code's down, so I'm good at the price."
"We can close the delivered delivery box: there's a layer of paper against the dam, a little distorted box that doesn't affect the earset."
"It's beautiful, it's the firm, it's the seal, it's fine, it's sustainable, it's not time to answer."
"Nice, careful package, better product on the picture."
Quick delivery within an hour. The sound of quality hope lasts.
"It sounds good compared to this price, so far, it still sounds good."
"At the sound of good, the blue's nice, you hear, the baby's really into it, the delivery's a little long, but it's a great deal, and it's going to support the shop."
"Tiki is slow but compensates for the quality of sp, the box is not distorted like some other shipping party"
Heh. Love is blue.
"I bought it from Tiki Trading super-quality, and the earpiece gave me four ears, and it sounded good, it's loud, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good."
"There's no sound button, but compared to the headset, that's quality!"
Negative.....
"Fast delivery, nice package, good quality for the price."
"This store is good, buying electronics onl mil for this store."
Use oke combination at price range
"There are three different kinds of muts, so you can pick the ones that match your ears. Nice color, it's just that when you get it, it's a little bit jumpy because blue is so blue."
"Great quality of sound, 5 stars"
"Good sound, good hearing, simple design, neat taste, good music, bad taste."
Good job
It's a little small. It's beautiful. It's a little much better than the price.
"The headset's 159k, but the quality's fine, it's not damaged, it's just a microphone test."
"Quick delivery, nice headset. Copy that. The mic hasn't got an evaluation yet."
It's consistent with the price.
"Good sound, different ear buttons, super fast delivery."
"It's a dirty box, but quick delivery, friendly shipper. I don't know yet."
"Listen, it's a good deal, it's guaranteed by tiki, so it's reassuring to buy it."
"Headset's fine, audio mics are good, colors are good, delivery's faster than expected."
The new product is high quality.
It sounds good. It's a good sound. It's a good price.
"Good sound, good price."
Good. Good. Nice ears.
"The product looks good, the price is within range, and Tiki's package is nice and sure, and it's moving fast."
"It's soft, no ear pain, sounds good, it's faster than expected."
"Quick delivery, clear sound"
Sound's fine. It's been good for months.
I hear it's good.
"Pack your bags carefully. <i>Okay, but I don't know if it's sustainable.</i> <i>A good headset is sound.</i> <i>Okay.</i> <i>Okay.</i> <i>I don't know if it's sustainable.</i> <i>I don't know if it's okay.</i> <i>I don't know if it's okay.</i> <i>I don't know if it's okay.</i> <i>I don't know if it's okay.</i> <i>I's okay.</i> <i>I's okay."
"Quick delivery, product exactly the way it's described, good use, solid packing, okay?"
I'm very pleased with the quality of sp and the quality of service. I like TiKi very much.

The company's main speed delivery.
Good.
"Good hearing ear, whole box."
"Quality product, quick delivery! <i>Simper friendly, enthusiastic.</i> <i>Five</i> <i>The shop.</i>"
Headsets. Okay. We've been doing it for months.
"Quality's fine at the price, fast delivery, should priority when buying"
I'm out of here! I'm out of here! I'm out of here!
"Quick delivery, package's still intact, official stamp."
It's a blanket that sounds really good.
"Sonys should be so strong, they're so hot, they're rubbers, they're good, they're good, they're good, they're good, they're good, they're good, they're good, they're good, they're good, they're good, they're good, they're good, they're good, they're good, they're good, they're good, they're good, they're good, they're good, they're good, they're good, they're good, they're good, they're good, they're good, they're good, they're good, they're good, they're good, they're good, they're good, they're good."
It doesn't sound very nice.
It's good. It's good. It's got three. It's cheap.

Good.
"It's genuine, like described."
"Let's try it. Okay, I don't know what's going on."
Very much with the product.
"I'm fine, I'm fine."
"Well, the quality is weak. Okay, well, the quality of perfection is a little thin."
"The medical product, it's very satisfying."
Quick delivery carefully packed. sp is exactly the same. Use ok
I'll leave the palace instead of the ghost.
"Good sound, fair price."
It's a very OK product.
Okay.
"It's just good to buy it, and after a month, the mic's out of focus."
Listen to the risk.
Sounds good.
Okay.
Phones are good. Sound's good.
It's all right.
"The good product, the right price."

Use it fine.
Good stuff.

"The beautiful product for teenage girls,"
It's a favorite product.
"It's all right, it's all right, it's all right, it's all right, it's all right, it's all right, it's all right, it's all right, it's all right, it's all right, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay?"
"I bought three laptops, a mouse, a full Visa keyboard, a very long period of time -- two things -- one thing I can't get -- one thing I can't get 10 times as soon as Tiki goes on the phone, the one-and-a-half days' notice -- there's no place on the app, there's no money, there's no money, there's no money to get it."
"The delivery was quite slow, and it took me two months to get it because of fluids, as well as long-term transportation, but in terms of quality, I was quite content, and I used to play the cheap sound of sony, wearing a pretty thin string, but the core was solid, so the time used was quite long."
The low-eared quality of hearing 70K on the floor.
"The product is cheap. <i>The quality of buid is not equal to Xiaomi position, even though the price is equal.</i> <i>The sound sounds are relatively fine.</i>"
"The first time was a bit disappointed with tiki for sending sp unlike in your picture search on Google, and no sony ex15ap model has a wire design like this."
"Nice headsets, long wires, soft wires. If you hear it, you get a little more bass, and you measure the quality of sound by four to five."
I don't know.
The volume is small (samsung) the pain in the ear after two hours of continuous use.
"I mean, it's kind of a bad look, but I don't like it, it's bad, it's bad, it's bad, it's bad, it's bad, it's bad, it's bad, it's bad, it's bad six months, it's bad, it's bad."
That doesn't sound very smooth.
The delivery is relatively fast. Okay.
It's okay. It's okay.
Unsatisfaction has broken out after two weeks of use.
How do you use this shop?
"Box doesn't look like a picture or dirty box, but it doesn't affect the quality of sp, tiki trick, so I believe it's real."
"This doesn't sound good, it's a soft price, so I'm only 3 seconds out."
"The product is fine, but the earpiece feels uncertain, fragile, and cheap."
I bought a month of broken mics. I can't hear you.
Son of a bitch sounds shy. Don't buy it.
"I just bought a 24-hour headset, and I heard it on the small side, asking for tiki's solution."
It sounds good.
"Bad quality sound, not good enough for Sony brands."
"Don't buy this kind of thing that's a little disappointing, but it's a common purpose. Okay."
Not happy. Not happy.
"Breakup, ask the shop to review the quality of the product before selling it."
Requested Requirement
"It takes more than a month to get the loud side of it, even if you don't have to twist it or hit it hard."
It's good to hear the call.
Listen to normal sound quality
Got an earful for a beautiful little baby who doesn't know what quality she's made of.
"Bad headset, easy to break."
Good. I'm very pleased.
Not happy. One side can't hear.
"Tiki delivers less quality, same code as your headset, but his earpiece sounds a very short bass sound."
"Sounds good, sounds good, but the mic's still a little shy."
"Listen to this sound sound sure, listening to rock matches, listening to music often doesn't work"
"It's okay, but the wire's pretty loose."
"The good stuff sounds good in the shop, but you don't know how to hold it."
"The sound's out, it's bad!"
"I can hear you. Okay, the color's on the outside. Look bad."
It's a little piece in your ear.
You're not as good as your ears and your bananas.
It's not very good. It's not very good. It's okay.
We're talking about soldiers in our family.
"Your hearing, your hearing, it's too small, it's boring."
"It's thin, it's not as loud as it's supposed to be."
Sound Stable
"It sounds normal, compared to the other, the same price, the same price is lost."
That's great.
"If you hear it for a month, you're dead."
You can't hear an ear in a month.
The little microphone sounds fine. You need to return the package.
"No, I'm funny, I'm bad, I'm bad, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm funny, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good."
"All right, but the rope's a little thin."
"I'm listening. Okay, exactly the code..."
What's wrong with your head? You can only hear L's head using 63 days?
Please.
The earpiece's too thin.
Only use microphones on the phone
"- Good. - Thanks, tiki."
"I bought it and spent it for two months, and I broke my ear, just like the cheap headsets I bought on the outside."
Good headset.
It's a match for the money bag.
Listen to me. Okay.
Okay.
"I've only bought four or five months on one side, and there's no warrant."
"I don't know what's going on, but if you hear it, it's not good music."
The Loar's shy.
"It's the real product, the quality's off the hook."
"At a price range, it's all right, it's nice, it's light."
"It's okay at the price point, two days late for delivery."
Fast delivery in two hours has been received.
"Mouse is fine at the price range, moving between smooth devices, however, the feeling of a mouse is still not good."
It's worth it.
"The product is too good at price range, good looks, smooth clicks, diverse connections, and the biggest plus point is that there's no leaving batteries."
Satisfaction
It's delicious.
"Hand over quickly, pack carefully"
Very okey
Okay.
It's okay. The legs aren't so slippery.
The package failed to send 2 clips and product indicates the product has been damaged but the owner said it's normal and then has to send it back to the firm to check for a 2-hour delivery mouse but it's only been used for 2 weeks.
"The press was too hard, the finger was tired, but it really didn't play, and the motion sensor wasn't very good, and compared to the A4GP at a price, it's a lot worse than the hard looks and the charge is used."
New item that the underside of the mouse has been scratched.
It's new to use. Okay.
"At 300K, it's pretty OK, it's adjustable, it's small, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good."
"It's because of whatever money he has, he's cheap, he doesn't expect much, he's good for using it for the use of deafness, he's good for the use of it, he's good for the use of it, he's good for the use of it on-line."
"The brand new company is 100 percent new, the dropper is not careful to wet the box and twist it but it's okay, the inside ear is intact, the prestigious Shop supports five stars."
"The quality product is good, but the price is equal."
Okay.
Satisfaction
A
It's good stuff.
Okay.
"It's good to listen to music, but it's not good to learn online. It's not good because the microphone is so small, it's like screaming on the other side, it's more than just waiting, it's buying two sets, it's a lot of ways to do it, so it's not a computer problem."
"The hearing sounds good, but the microphone's small, buying two kids online that you can't hear normally, and you can't even talk like scream."
"Tiki has the criteria for ""Easy Pays"" but it's not, the product is uncomfortable, it's ear pain, the product has two moles and one speaker so it doesn't work with the current computer, and Tiki doesn't support the product when it's open to check on the product, the return policy of Tiki doesn't specify this information."
"The earpiece's fine, but there's two plugs, one mic, one earphone, and my laptop can only plug a hole in it."
I can hear you when I can't hear you.
It fits the old machine's life to have two sockets for mics and speakers.
Microphones are small when we talk.
Line OK.
"It's a nice, neat, little charge style. A 20-watt PD charge for the right price should be worth buying."
"It's okay, but charging three devices at the same time is a little slow because it's only 36."
"It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's..."
"The charge is too good to charge, it's very secure, it's a quick charge, it's a 61-watt charge you can charge, it's worth a lot of money."
"The charges, like the earth, are small and small, and they charge fast without any heat, which is standard quality RVPWER. One point is tiki delivers very quickly."
"Thank you, Shop."
"Yeah, they're good. They're good. They're good, they're good. They're good, they're good, they're good, they're good, they're good, they're good, they're good, they're good, they're good, they're good, they're good, they're good, they're good, they're good, they're good, they're good, they're good, they're good, they're good for the store, they're good money."
"The charge looks solid, it's small, it's rounded up, it's perfect, it's high charge, I love it."
Okay.
"We're getting super fast stuff. Next night, there's a lot of charge. Okay, it's charging very fast."
It's a little bigger than expected.)
AdaPer LPD 2 Type-C In/Out well fits the description
"Good quality, sure, quick charge"
"The charge is extremely fast, especially against charge for iphone."
"It's small, it's easy to carry, it's more cool than to charge the company, it's been a long time but it's not a problem."
"The delivery's early, but we're pretty sure the RAVPWER is loaded."
"Fast, white, beautiful design."
Quality
Sp good
Pretty sure you can use it well.
"Fast hit, just like the description."
"It's a very good product, friendly delivery, nice package."
"We got a quick charge, we're good."
It's all right.
"Move it, move it, move it, move it, move it, move it, move it, move it, move it, move it, move it, move it, move it, move it!"
"Over the skin, very good, very nice."
It's good. I haven't used it in a long time.
"Quick, nice hit."
"Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes."
Let's hit it fast.
"Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go."
It's all right.
"Okay, it's exactly like a commercial."
delivered quickly package well
You're as pretty as advertised.
Good.
Good.
Okay.
Aaaaah
Okay.
Okay.
Fine.
"I've been buying and using it for three months, and I've noticed that there's a call from Adaström when it comes to electricity and the shell appears to be swollen, and I'm very worried about the fire."
"I bought it because I thought it was an American brand like the one on the picture, but Sunvatlett is Chinese and Chinese brands look a little bit clearer."
The Adoptor I received was not exactly the same size as the information on the product.
"The charge head's been scratched. The package's still in the box, new but no idea why the charging head's got a scratch on both of them."
Thought it'd charge fast and it'd be luon's spare battery.
"Buying it to charge S22 assist (max 45W) but, in fact, it's slower than the 25W charge on the MCP. Wants to pay back the money because it doesn't look like a commercial."
"The new cave, the whole set, the outer shell doesn't look so good, the current is pretty good, but it's not good for samsung."
"The design is quite large, it's rough, it doesn't make sense to replace the charges with equal capacity within the price range."
"Small, neat, stable, average completion."
Could not load the Android phone with type C. Only charge the iPhone
It's fine. It's not as fast as you'd expect.
"She's got no fingerprints, she's got heavy hands."
"It's a little big, and the other one's OK."
"Okay, well, we've got nothing to complain about or complain about before."
"We don't yet know the quality yet, but the package is good, careful, and professional."
"Shop, I bought the wrong wire, I can't charge my charge."
Anker is the one that's cheaper than the outside and the tmdt floors up to 40 percent.
"The cable's solid, the charge's quick, the charge's really good."
"Big tight, tight tight wire when you're plugging or pulling it off easy."
"The second time I've bought this cable, but I'm still very happy to get the goods, and I'm very sure it's okay, and I'm very relieved to buy tiki's goods."
"The company's main goods, the package is carefully packed, the delivery is quick, buys the one-and-a-half-foot rope, buys the one-way charge."
"Anker's product is much more expensive, but quality is reassuring."
"Whatever it is, the product's too good. Not everyone's willing to spend that much money on a charge cable, but the quality of the product is too much."
"I haven't tried it yet, but it's packed carefully."
"My charge cable has started to have a slow and regular charge phenomenon that can't be connected to the damage, unplugged while charging itself, and the maintenance of this product is 18 months, right? Do you want to get the warranty support, then contact Tiki, or do you have to release Anker's store yourself?"
"Good quality, long-term stability, it's been used for a couple of years! Well, that's an illustration, don't worry about it."
"Quality product, solid wire, new usage, that's fine."
"Long enough. <i>Looks hard, but not hard.</i> <i>It's fine.</i> <i>There's a stick to wrap the rope up.</i>"
"It's faster than you can imagine, and it's more satisfying to buy it on tiki, which is a favorite tks shop color."
"If tiki's selling it, fuck it, like it or not."
"The package is well packed, be careful, Ship delivers decently, on time."
"I bought the whole Anker set, but I didn't pick the rope any longer, Tikinow delivered it super fast."
"It's been a while, it's full stamps, so I'm sure the main charge is fast enough to last a while."
I don't think that's a table.
"He's a judge, but good, still a loyal fan with anker."
The fabric product is beautiful and sure.
"It's good, it's good, it's fast, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good."
"Fast delivery, carefully packed will further support next time"
"Long ropes are convenient, the wire looks very sure, the head doesn't break fast, the charge's pretty fast."
Good quality delivery.
"It's three meters long, and it's loaded, and it's running all over the room, and it's not gonna miss a beat."
"Good use of good, friendly shiper quick delivery."
Ha-ha-ha-ha.
"The product's good, Tiki's fast, the quality's off the table."
"That's a pretty good wire, plug it in the super fast charge."
"Fast delivery, well packed, very good product quality"
The charge line is stable. The parachute should be very secure. The package is packed in the box.
aaa
"Convenient, quick delivery, quality."
"Quick delivery, 20 percent price."
Anker is always okay.
"Good wire material, quick delivery."
Cell Quality
Thanks tiki.
"Buying goods quite often for family and friends, sustainable products, cut off the company's main cable"
Straight-to-the-clock
"This Anker cable is very good, and the speed of charging when using this cable is equivalent to the main cable of an even-sharp cable, the feeling of holding a cable in your hand is quite good because the material is made of an umbrella-like shell."
"Quality ok, the box is beautiful, the wire is strong, it's good."
"Quick delivery, standard delivery, good price"
Good stuff.
The company's main product is good.
"Quick delivery, cheaper than any other floor."
"Steady parachutes, quick charge."
"The cable's fine, the stamp's sealed enough, but it's kind of old-fashioned."
"Thank you so much, tiki."
It's very good. It's great. It's great. It's very fast.
"It's eight feet long, it's got boxes, it's got labels, it's got a sack of wire."
"Main goods, good charges, solid wires, extra bags that are very convenient."
It's good. It's good. It's good.
Line up! Use it!
Good product.
"Quickly charged, to spend some time testing the durability"
"Hurry, holdnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn"
Well see later ntn
"It's all yours. It's all yours, it's all yours, it's all yours, it's all yours, it's all yours, it's all yours, it's all yours, it's all yours, it's all yours, it's all yours, it's all yours, it's all yours!"
"We buy and use it for a long time, and now we get to review, and there's stamps, full boxes, good use, there's nothing to complain about."
"Long, sure."
"Sure thing, very good stuff."
"INSTRUCTIONS, INSTRUCTIONS."
I'm still using Anker's backup charge.
"Quick delivery, good good good goods, full case shells, raw seal"
The charge line is definitely beautiful.
"Solid wire, good use."
Good.
"It's good, it's good, it's good, it's good."
Very good.
"Because you're an alcoholic, you don't have to be cheap."
"It's OK, it's safe to use it."
Anker's too secure.
Wire wire
"Early morning order, this afternoon already there."
Anker's the best.
Good rope.
That's a good response.
A solid charge line.
Okay.
Fine quality
Real charge.
Thjfbn
Good.
The last one bought about six months.
Good.
Right and right. Apple doesn't need to be afraid to charge the new iPhone.
That's good stuff.
Cool.
"The battery's a little slow, but you can see for sure, the pattern's pretty fast, the office's at 0500 in the morning, it's not 8 o'clock in the morning."
Should have bought it.
"Tiki delivers fast, well packed, fast and nice charged wire, plus skin sacks, pretty neat."
Good.
Approval
FORth
Okay.
"Buying it for him, hearing him say that he is a beautiful string, and he seems to be stable, making quick delivery."

"Good quality.The wire makes sure, the durability to use to view ntn"
"It's good to use, fast to charge, nice black to match the black aker charge."
"With an aker charge, it's okay, but it's a quick charge, so it's pretty hot."
"Good stuff, quality okay."
That's right. That's right. That's not right.
"Quick delivery, sustainable product, as good as you can expect, worth the money."
"Fast delivery, company itself, very good product quality."
"The charge's fine, the envelope's nice, the quality's not a table."
Okay.
"Hard cable cable, MFI, Unsharp, Perfect quality."
The wire is solid and the charge is fast.
"It's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good."
"It's fast, it's hard, it's hard."
"Steaming wire, I use an IPX charge with a pretty fast anker charge."
It's a very good product.
"Good stuff, good stuff, good stuff, good stuff, good stuff, good stuff, good stuff, good stuff, good stuff, good stuff, good stuff, good stuff, good stuff, good stuff, good stuff, good stuff, good stuff, good stuff, good stuff, good stuff, good stuff, good stuff, good stuff, good stuff, good stuff, good stuff, good stuff, good stuff, good stuff."
Good quality even if I buy it for the first time!
Good.
"It's good to be brought back with goods, strong wires, very trusting anker."
"It's quick, and it's not bad, but it's a lot of money, but okay?"
It's exactly the way it's described.
"It's not a big deal, it's high quality, it's quick."
"Fast, good, steady wire, quick delivery..."
I hope it lasts a long time.
"Multiple sp iios compatible, sp ok"
"First of all, I've got to say that the British delivery guy works very well, and I'm not getting the goods."
May I ask if I can get a warrant from TiKi?
Very good.
"I've responded to tiki, but I don't get any feedback."
I've bought it for the second time. It's fine. The wire's solid. The charge's got a zinc charge.
"The package hasn't broken yet, the quality to use the time... but the delivery is super slow... ordered from 12/11... to deliver 24/11 to 27/11... to improve the delivery..."
"I bought an Anker charge cable, which I found good, and I believed in buying it, but when I put it on my computer, my phone was hot and my phone wasn't fully charged, and then my phone said, ""This charge doesn't work for NOC, I tried it a lot, but I've never bought one of Anker's things and I'm disappointed, but this time Anker lets me down too much because the charge is not cheap."
"The charge I just bought two days ago, the charge went haywire. It's very disappointing because I've bought two kinds of wire at the same price, which is not cheap, and it's always broken."
It's about 10 times - 15 times when the charge won't enter the power again.
"Once a month, the charge lines are loose."
There's no strong link between the related parts.3. There's no action that's going to be fully processed for the user.
What's with the warranty now? <i>We're still very much on an aker.</i> <i>We're buying some more rope for a few weeks and nothing's missing.</i> <i>The wire's still fresh.</i> <i>Is that auth?</i> <i>We're all new.</i> <i>The wire is still fresh.</i> <i>We're all new.</i> <i>I don't know what it is.</i> <i>It's happening.</i> <i>We's new.</i> <i> <i>It's new.</i> <i>I's new.</i> <i>I's new.</i> <i>I's new.</i> <i>It's new.</i> <i>It's new.</i>I's new.</i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i>

"I bought a cable for two months and I lost it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it."
"Quick spear, row"
Why don't we check the code on the home page?
"Use a kilo, a kilo of electricity, real shit."
The product box's a little distorted by transportation.
"A week's worth of charging, and you don't get into the power."
It's a good day's charge. It's the same as the rope that follows the machine.
"It's good, but it's expensive, it's cheaper to buy from Joybry."
The perishable product that lasts about a month or two is not going into power.
What?
"The product is solid, the parachute wire and the angle design are very reassuring."
Use it well.
I remember putting in a line of 0.9 meters and getting 1.8 meters.
Pack your bags carefully. It's too slow to deliver.
"Long rope, four stars..."
I've read a lot of reviewers as well as reviews on the ibuprofen before I bought this baby.
I'm very pleased with my product at less than 650k.
"Tiki Now, packing okay."
"It's nice, it's nice, it's light, it's light, it's smart."
"Sony's hearing doesn't have to talk about quality at a price, so it sounds good, but it's a little bit hot at first, but it doesn't make sense."
Fine. Good tiki service.
"Sound's fine, the wire's a little thin, you're afraid of a break, the delivery's on time."
"It's nice, it's neat, it's very nice, it's very loud, it's very nice."
"Because I'm not a professional, I don't have a good sound quality, I feel very good personally."
"Well, I've been using it for a long time, and even though it's just an amateur sound adjustment for some pop music projects and music mix, I think it's very good and it's very similar to loud, more expensive speakers. There's only one thing that's wrong with microphones, and if you turn on loud audio, then the microphones get back, too, if you're used to sound in high volume, so pay attention."
"Very fast delivery (in less than 24 hours) press button. The product quality is fine, not too special. This white color is beautiful, it goes, it suits girls like me, and it buys good prices, so I really like it."
"The product, like him, comes with fake stamps and the warranty makes me a little bit more comfortable, and when I'm on bass I'm pretty good, you guys."
"That's a pretty nice product, listen to bass music that's pretty high? And this earpiece uses jack 3.5mm integrating mic+audio on the same port, so if you buy a PC or laptop, you should buy a jack convert to mic+audio, because if you don't buy it, you can only use one of the microphones or headphones functions."
Sound clean sound good.
"Good quality, nice gift pack!"
"Pack your goods, your speaker sounds good, your price's good."
"I've got 90 percent sound, I've got coffee, I've been working, I've been having a lot of noise, I've been playing with my hair, I've got no max volum, I've been able to focus all day, I've bought on low tiki, I've got my ears taken off on the outside, I've got my fingers on the side."
"I put it this afternoon, even though I'm outside the city, Tiki never lets me down about the delivery, but it's okay for the product, the beautiful pattern is the most satisfying thing I've ever had to do."
"The product has a beautiful form, a good quality, but it's a little loose compared to the person with a small head size like me."
"I don't know what sounds like, so I don't want to analyze them."
"It's soft, it's good sound, bass's good, it's worth the rice money for the weak budget that wants to buy your headset."
This one I used for New Year's.
Shipper's not doing well.
"Good sound at a price range, beautiful long-time pain in ear, high bass type, like Blackpink, which is really cool."
"The earpiece is sweet and beautiful, but the earpieces look a little small and thin, hoping the earpieces will last and use them for a long time."
"The white ear is very nice, look at it, light and sound is very clear, the call/stop button is also very convenient."
"The sound tone, the inner sound, the voicephone is clear, but this isn't what I care about, Tiki delivers fast, reliable delivery, and on the market there's probably a 300-year-old (not surprising) hearing device, but it's not something I care about."
"Pleased against the price, packaged goods carefully, however set the Tikinow which the next day receive the package."
"Nice hearing ears, sharp hearing, soft ears no pain in the ear beautiful pattern packed carefully, fast welding"
"The product sounds good, doesn't sound out, it's going to hurt your ear."
"Good Bass, don't get earaches long."
Good.
"Super fast delivery, lunch order, stand by, and some quality test is okay."
"The material is cheap, so it's not too sure, but the light ear, the sound quality, is fine compared to the amount of money."
"Nice looking, to spend some time watching. With Sony's export stamp, I'm sure you'll be relieved."
"Tiki delivers fast, the product runs the company."
"I like to sound loud, because I'm used to it, so it sounds a little small."
The earpiece uses light; the sound is clear. S generally uses ok; fits the price.
"The sound sounds very loud, but the hearing looks a little weak."
"It's okay. It's not about listening to music, but it's gonna make sure school hears you, watch movies."
"Fast delivery, the product is complete as described, however possible, to be negative at an average level."
"Listen to good, honest, good audio, no big talk, no people on the other side can hear you, so buy it."
"It's been a while since we've started buying this son of a bitch, just scared big and rough, but when we're picking up the stuff and it's just right, it's good enough, it's good enough, it's fast, it's good enough, it's good enough, it's good enough, it's good enough, it's good enough, it's good enough, it's good enough, it's good enough, it's good enough, it's good enough."
"I have to say, Sonny's making this girl a little bit more tasty, he's listening to some heavy music, he's getting better at it, but I'm using him as a real player, all the sounds are clear, he's got to say it's loud, it's really good, but whoever buys it, he's supposed to avoid white because the weather in Vn is going to make it go very fast."
"I heard bass beating all over the place, shooting all over the place."
"Good headsets, no warrants, so the warrants go by electronic bills, right?"
"It's okay, it's a good look, it's a fair price."
"Ok, quick delivery is expected, i.k.E.E.E.L.D."
"The company's main product, which is quite secure, of origin, but there's no point in adjusting the volume and the wires that look a little thin, and that's generally okay."
It's good. It's good. It's good. It's good.
"Pack it carefully, so it's supposed to be 4/4 days, but the next day there's a package (in Hanoi)."
The earpiece likes. Isn't it better to hear her poetry?
"Use it well, wear it long, have earaches"
"Nice hearing, good quality of sound at the price range."
"Good ear, loud talk, good for the office."
Yeah.
"Tiki's quick delivery, her own earpiece, she's got a warranty ticket, she's not wrong with the technology, she's sound good, she's got the quality, and when she gets a bag of lipstick, it's about 200K lower than any other place, and it's not very reassuring at first, but until she gets it, it's incredibly satisfying."
"Good headsets, but wearing them for a long time is a little hot."
"At first the sound didn't sound like what it was supposed to be, but then it was a lot better."
"OK, pack carefully."
"The sound is clear and it's deep, it's been spent a day."
It's OK!
"The sound you've used for a while is still sound clear, the quality's still good."
"I bought this piece because Sony fan, which is kind of nice, and I got some comments like, ""I just bought it so it's normal"" -- the bass isn't good enough -- the bass is good, it's very high, it's much more critical -- the long ear scans get hot and sweat -- the rest are good; the rest are good, Tiki delivers fast."
good quality
Good.
"As expected, thank Tiki"
"The sound quality, the color, the code, it's all very good."
Sp good
"Sounded fine with mics, easy to use."
"A good headset at a price range, which I've spent over a year, but I haven't seen any old decay, but the bass is not very good, the hearing is appropriate for the country, pop."
"Nice headsets, very smooth shots, even if they're wearing them for a long time, they don't feel an earache."
The earpiece is good.
"It's good at the price, it's good to buy for over two years, but it's good, it's good to buy, it's good to buy."
I'm satisfied with the delivery.
"The quality of sound OKe, however it's a little painful but okay to wear."
"The price was good and nice at the same price as the discount price, so the price was pretty cheap, and it was kind of soft, and it wasn't easy to do the moping, but the price was also going to be equal to the price."
"Good products, like descriptions, sound quality is also bt, worth money and brands!"
"It's light, it's very fine."
good product
It's money.
"The delivery's on schedule, the quality's good, the price's good, the price's good."
"Good stuff, good stuff."
"I've never used this kind of earpiece before, after a few months of using it, I'm giving this product five stars, quality sounds good, I hear it with smartphone, the results are fine."
OK.
Okay. The delivery's too fast. It's always good job.
It's great.
"The quality of sound is good and it's really good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it sounds good, it sounds long, it doesn't hurt."
Okay.
Great.
"Good headset, carefully packed."
"Nice headsets, but the warranty records the store from April 30th,2019, while I'm just getting it today, September 9th,1919, hoping tiki will respond."
"Good earset, worth the price."
"The sound is fine within the price range, suitable for unprofessional listeners."
Goof
"Nice, soft ear for the ear, relatively warm, just holding the head."
Fast delivery and quality delivery.
Okay.
Okay.
Good literature.
It's good. It's quick. It's convenient.
"The Sony MDR-ZX310AP -- there's Mic -- is the most amazing product I've ever bought -- the sound that comes out of it is so real, so tickled -- I used this hand to listen to music, to watch movies, to watch movies -- it's so beautiful -- Tiki wrapped so quickly, so careful, a wonderful product at this price!"
The headset's pretty cool. It's a little loose.
It's good. It's good. It's good.
"I got the product on May 17, and after two days of enjoyment I got this: the sound was so good, the sound was so clear, there was nothing to say about it, and Tiki gave it quite quickly, and it was only set up on 16th, the 17th day was there, although I didn't use the form of quick delivery, and I'm just a little sad because I just got the product today, and Tiki offered me the ear bag when I bought it."
"I've just received the product from Tiki's 24-hour delivery service, holding the plastic product in my hand at the tender point of breaking, about sony's bar from very deep bass hearing very clear, and it's probably worth about 74 GHz."
It's a quick delivery.
Very fast delivery.
"I buy tiki's sale with only 700k -- delivery every day, the cute one -- the good sound ear, the right word, but I have glasses, so when I put them in my ear, it's a little painful."
"Headset's light, clear."
"I bought this by New Year's Eve as a gift for my brother-in-law, when I bought for a bonus of 690k, I consulted my firm and all the other goods that sold for 890k, which, like the description, loved the tiki package, looked very respectful to the buyers, hoping that tiki would grow even more and bring a lot of good products to everyone."
Good.
"It's okay, it's got a warranty."
Okay.
"Quick delivery, ordered by chem from Saturday afternoon, which is a pretty nice white ear, which is very comfortable, which just doesn't make much sense, has a full bass, doesn't make a lot of sense, or because of a bug phone."
broad audio strip
That's a good sound!
"Just received from tiki is a beautiful, sophisticated red box, and listening to an English dialogue, a sound that is perfectly sound without any shock, especially given a light, well-equipped box, which is more likely to travel, which is a product than expected."
Very pleased.
Sounds good in the price segment
"Thank you, Tiki, quality earset, thanks!"
And the quality of sound is excellent at the price.
Gout
sp tot
Okay.
"It's been a long time since I bought it. When I bought it, I was 700k, and it was cheap. It was worth it."
It's pretty quality.
"Sony MDR-ZX10AP hearing ears with a light, easy-to-go design to carry on my tours, it's very comfortable to wear headphones, with very soft leather cushions, no more hearing pain when I remove my ears, but also a pretty good quality sound for most of my music taste: pop, yellow music, young music... other than that common standardized product, which makes it easier for me to connect with various devices to enjoy music wherever I go."
"The light hearing, the long-term wear without ear pain, the quality of sound that's great, doesn't say, and compared to other stores, it's a little cheaper, and for less than a million, it's probably the best product I've ever used."
"Real Sp, good price."
"Great quality of sound, quick delivery, carefully packed."
It's okay. It's been three months. It's been okay.
"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no."
"The sound earpiece is very catchy, the beautiful pattern, the details are also very careful not to be like other valuable earpieces, the product for sound quality is good compared to price! if it's a Sony fan and it doesn't have the financial ability to buy high-cost products, it's a good item to buy!"
"Tiki delivered the cave 24 hours very quickly, and it's very good to listen to the bass sound, which is very good to buy, it's worth it, it's a discount at Tiki's where it's bought."
Good.
"Buying and using it for a long time, the sound sounds good, the price of buying at the time of kilometers, so it's okay."
"Sounds good, stable, satisfied."
Okay.
All good except the dropout date was 2020.
OK.
"You get the package very quickly, you get the seventh order, you've got it, you've got the package, you've got the red ear, you've got no hard feelings, you've got the quality, you've got the burn, you've got the press card, you've got the press card, you've got the general satisfaction with this product."
"I bought this sort of green headset, which is so beautiful, the ear can fold, so it's easy to carry a backpack or a laptop all the time, and the quality of sound has been tested through Sony's brand a long time ago, and I'm very happy with this product."
"It's good stuff, but it's been a bit of an earache."

"The faster Tiki delivers, the better, the better, the better, the better, the better, the better, the better, the better, the better view for most of the equipment, the better for the microphone, the better for the voice chat, the better for my friends to buy."
"Tiki delivers quickly, packaged well, warranted, full warranty, Sony quality doesn't say very well, it sounds smooth, it covers your ears, it's kind of good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it'"
Good.
"Nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice."
"Sp use good, I'm satisfied"
"Okay, that's right with QC."
"The sound hearing is very fond of the good bass is Sony's characteristic, but it's still a little confusing when the bag is outside when it comes in very dirty and scratched."
"Good earphones at the price range, good Bass, audio, quick delivery, cover, and nice packs, thank you."
TERRIA
"It's a nice package, it's a pretty warm ear, it's used to listen to music at work and to listen to English, and there's no big defect in general, it's just a lot of pain in the ear."
"Good earset, sustainable, bought a year and a half."
"Tiki delivers fast, set eight o'clock tomorrow morning at nine o'clock."
It's a good ear.
"I've just received the goods, the black ones, each of the Sony logos that are misprinted against the center, sound sounds clear, bass is fine, my favorite thing is to multiply the goods very quickly from HCM to HN, which is less than two days, while the order is expected to take four days."
"Buying all the companies' rooms with all the colors, no need to talk about sound quality."
"I'm very pleased with the products I bought on Tiki, the quality of the product, the sound of the product, the speed of the delivery."
"I just bought it yesterday, it sounds so good, I'm sure it's high, I'm not a pro, I can't tell you how deep it looks, I can't see it, I can't see it, I can feel it, I can't even say Sony's a brand that's famous for quality hearing."
"Tiki delivers fast, careful, very nice, little earpieces, good bass, fair price."
"It's well packed, it's very sound, it's sustainable, it's been two years. It's still not a problem."
"Right quality, right firm, carefully packed, beautiful pattern."
"tiki delivers fast, ears sound good, use sustainable"
"The quality of the product, the delivery on time."
"It's small, but it's beautiful."
That's great.
"Nice product, quality, eye-to-eye color, worth money."
"Let's just say that the tiki delivery is like a wind in the product, and then there's a bad luck line. (Laughter) The ear is a little bit small."
"Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go!"
"It's a good sound, in line with the price you spend, but it's going to hurt your ears for a long time."
Good!! The fast delivery of goods will trust and use the long tiki!!!
"The quality ear, the fast stocking."
"The sounds are clear, the sounds are also good compared to the price we have to pay to own them."
"It's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's quick delivery."
"The sound is good, it's perfect, it's buyable and useable!"
The plug's broken. I can't plug it.
"I don't know what face I'm wearing, I don't know what I'm wearing, I don't know what I'm hearing, I don't know what sound sounds like."
"Hi guys, the product's not as good as we're supposed to be, and Sony's long-term policy isn't good, and it's affecting the rights of Kwa I want to return this product to you"
"The product is very fine within the price, bass and treble are pretty sure compared to the first two earcassettes (Nokia 8 earpieces with the broken wire and the Xiami Mosses with poor quality wires). When memory is plugs into your laptop or plugs into your phone, the tablet has DAC support for FLAC(24-bit/2bit/92kHz) or some machine with the help of Dolby Atmos, THX is too good, if using the phone, then a DAC/MP head is good. Often these sorts of things I get used to wear are a little bit too long but also over time ago, I've been able to work a long time ago."
"The rest of the goods, sounds relatively temporary, are used for watching movies or *** online."
"I'm buying a gift, so I'm only listening to one good sound at this price, and it looks nice."
"The package is packed, the quality is good, and it's a shame it doesn't carry a bag to put in a backpack for long-term trips, although the design is quick, as always, that Tiki delivers the goods later than expected."
"I mean, what's the point of having an earache? I don't think it's the right thing to do."
"I'm pretty good at wearing pain, even though my head's small, my big head's got a lot more pain, and after using these headsets for a few days, I'm in pain, and I can't tell if it's my hearing ear, but I don't understand why I've got an ear attack, and it's very rare now, and I haven't heard it before."
"The delivery's been a long time, like eight days, the good stuff, it's no problem for me, because Sony's got a pretty good warranty, so I'm relieved."
"The quick delivery is the right color, the sound quality is good, but depending on the transmitter, it sounds like a little bit of a GSA A5 207 sound, but it sounds a little bit small, but it's a lot bigger, and it doesn't sound much thicker, and it doesn't sound so much better, and it's good."
"Bass isn't as strong, as attractive as a speaker across the Microlab, as disappointed as Sony, light as a package, nice looking, quick delivery, fun Shipper."
"I'm satisfied with all of this, from packing, shipping, to products and gifts, and the only disappointment of the warranty ticket, and the dropout date is 20/2016 and has been of no more value than 18 months since the dropout, but I've already bought it."
"It doesn't sound straight, it doesn't make it clear between bass and mid."
"Playing some loud bass tunes, getting a warranty tiki, getting a bunch of loud speakers today, I don't know if tiki's gonna give it back, and then bringing it back, the speaker hasn't been able to buy it for a month."
Take it at a price range because no earaches have normal quality.
"I don't know very well, but I don't know how the bass plays but it's got a lot of force, but it's a little low volume, it's a little bit of fun, but it's a lack of emotion, it's a lack of emotion, it's a lack of details, it's a lack of music."
"It's normal. It's just negative at an acceptable level, jbl at the same price. It's better, the head's a little small, it's easy to get ear pain."
"It's exquisite, it's appropriate for both men and women, and the quality of sound is off the table because it's extremely sound, and it's worth it, and it's worth it, and it's always from shopping to delivery, where people can rest assured about the quality and the price."
"Besides the quality of sound, the rest of them aren't very happy."
Quick delivery.
The delivery was faster than expected.
"It's only three to four hundred worth of hearing ears and hearing ears that can hear outside, when it hurts all the time."
Can you hear me? I can hear you. I can hear you. I can hear you. I can't hear you.
Fine.
"The warehouse came out of 2020 and the warranty expired, the shell looked very old, it wasn't new, it felt like old stuff."
"The order from October 10th, Tiki's supposed to be delivered on September 19th, then delay's seven more days, and it's boring, and you've got nine days to deliver it to you, and now it's 15 days."
"The delivery's two days slower than the order was supposed to be, and it used a JBL and a 900k, which sounds better than this one."
"First, I'm impressed by how fast the delivery time must be, and as for the quality of earmark, one box doesn't have any impression."
"The delivery, packing the product OK, good within the price range."
Good quality delivery.
"The quality is equal to the price of money, music is fine, but if you listen to it for a long time, your ear is bad, your white ear is bad, your eyes are old, your ears are small, so it's bad for a long time."
Quality's fine. It fits the money.
"I'm going to buy more than the two sides of tiki, and I'm going to try to get more new goods."
I can't hear on a boring computer.
"I bought it for online study, so I found it OK, delivery is as fast as the wind."
"The product's fine, but there's no sound method."
"Takes it a little slow, packaged. Good ear quality (just received) for a few days. Takes a little bit of ear scan."
"You know, I just ordered your earpieces, but it's not right, so I'd like to give you back your needs. I'm back 600k."
"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no., no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no., no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,"
"In this range, the quality of the earpiece is acceptable, and on the outside, the tip of the ear is very nice and fashion, I'm very pleased, and the inside pads are very nice and comfortable, not as some of you say."
"The product in shape, the hope lasts."
"The delivery is the right product, the right color. The sound quality is normal. It's not so impressive."
It's okay. It's still loud from the outside sound.
"There's nothing to complain about from shipping to quality, but the plastic film should feel a little thin."
It's okay to use it.
It took too long to deliver.
"The quality doesn't sound right, it sounds like it's small, and it's about 200K across the ear range."
"Quick delivery goods can open them up and check their ears, but the bass isn't strong yet, the sound is normal!"
"It's pretty good at price. Design's pretty simple, but hopefully it's sustainable."
"It works, except for one star because it's a bit expensive for quality."
"I bought it while tiki was taking ale+, so it was only 650k, and when I got it, it was pretty cool because it was a beautiful model and it was given me another bag of headsets, but I didn't have the negatives in the middle, and I didn't have the threes as much as I expected."
"I got a package yesterday, and my hearing ear was designed, and my voice was red, and it was metal, so it was pretty cool, but except for the sound quality, it was small, and I had to adjust the volum to the nearest level before I heard normal, and the plus was Tiki's delivery on time."
"The sound is normal, I personally feel it."
We're good. We're good. We're good.
I've been using my headset for over a month.
"It's easy to see, it's elegant, it's light, it's light, it's easy to fold it into a bag that's not scary, it's not too long, it's not too long, it's pretty good, it's nice, it's still not very good for me, but it's not much fun for the fake product."
"...ben tiki delivered the cave quickly, and it's because of its creation, after buying a ladder."
"It's old-fashioned, it's kind of dirty."
"I bought you blue, and I liked it when I saw it. And I heard it on my phone, and I heard it in blue, and I didn't have the ear or the head of my old sister, but I didn't know if it was because my brother had a problem that I was feeling a little bit loose, and I didn't kill him in the ear."
Okay. Sounds smooth.
"So Category says it's over-ear. <i>I hate that it's over-ear.</i> <i>I hate that it's on-ear.</i> <i>It's on-ear.</i> <i>After 30 minutes of use.</i> <i>Two.</i> <i>I'm not sure it looks like it's cheap.</i> <i>Even if it's 750k</i> <i>The sound quality is okay, especially bass."
The sound's a little small.
"The bass doesn't sound so good either, but it's okay for people who like to listen to bass, and the volt audio sounds great."
"I got this earpiece from tiki, and after some time of use there was this observation: beautiful color, honest sound, very deep and warm bass, the whole box full of boxes, only to lack of boxes compared to you directly to the store, generally satisfied with this product of tiki."
"It sounds like a lot of other headsets, it doesn't make any difference."
"It's beautiful, it sounds nice, but it's fragile because it's made of plastic with little wires."
"I'm not a professional either, but my sense of self is that the quality is probably okay."
"- I thought it was Over-Ear (Head) because I thought Tiki was wrong. - On-Ear really, it's okay, because I didn't know enough."
"The Sony doesn't have to talk about it, but even though it's impossible to compare with the Seneiser or Technica but at this price, the earpiece is pretty clear, Bass is warm."
"It's not a good idea, it's a good thing, it's a nice look on the outside, it's a nice look, it's a very professional look and it's a nice look but my hearing pad is lucky and it's probably a little bit bad for me to do this part, and inside the field it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's not painful, it's like all sorts of ears."
"I bought Sony MDR-ZX10AP on the last Black Friday, and the price was 605K."
"Got the product, blue, tiki delivers fast, satisfied, about the product: the exact sign of Sony's company, which has a six-month warranty stamp, which sounds like, not as good as JBL or Beat, but it works for price."
"It's good hearing, it's ear hugs, it's good for soft music, it's great bass, except this time it's a little late for delivery, but tiki solves it pretty fast and it's okay, so it's okay."
The product's good.
"I've just bought this 48-hour downset in Tiki on October 10th, and I've got nothing to say about packing and delivery."
"I bought my product at low tiki, which I think is a discount for quality, light hearing should be pretty comfortable, my ears are a little stiff, but wearing short time doesn't sting, about an hour, my voice is fine, but I think it's a little off-the-side that I don't know that all of these ears are kind of hard, but it's just my own."
"When I first got this, I used my phone to listen -- very disappointed -- but when I put it on my laptop -- it sounded a lot different, because my laptop had a better sound processing system -- and it was kind of light, and it was long, but it didn't feel uncomfortable or tired, very comfortable."
It's normal. It's too painful.
"It's easy for long to get earaches from small speakers, which is a little loud and easy for people around you, no soundproof."
I bought my headset in March. It's a 19% discount rate of 70K. It's almost a month off. It's okay to watch a movie with regular music. It's okay.
"I got the goods last week, tiki delivered on time, the product I experienced felt good even though this was sony's mid-level hearing stream."
"No, no, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no., no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no., no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,"
"One, fast delivery, good, two, however, if you look at bass, you lose a rock zircon ear at half the price."
Quality at a price range.
"I've bought it, and I've got a lot of colleagues with experience, and everybody's saying it's pretty good quality, but everybody's afraid that the hearing part will be burned after spending a long time with Diep Le on the fact that Tiki gave the product inaccurate information."
Okay.
"They're good, they're young, they're cool."
"I multiply every two days, and it just so happens that when I listen to music today, I don't want to press pause/ Next, and it doesn't work either."
It's okay. It's nice. It's nice.
The ear can hear very well. Every sin is small.
Good.
"I've been buying this product since January 15 and I've been using it so far, it's just taking too long for my ear scan to come out."
I just bought one of them. I haven't been able to get them for a month.
"It's a quick delivery, it's okay, it's okay, it's not all in the ear, it's still open, it doesn't sound good, it's not very good."
The delivery was so fast... put it back in the morning... and it sounded so smooth... and the bag was a little rough... and it looked like fake...
I can only use the mic and the button. It's been broken for a long time. It's still a slight earache.
I bought it for two days and used it constantly because I liked it very much.
Looks good to me.
"Disillusionment, two-hour delivery, and the procedure's been returned for too long. It's been a week. It's not over yet."
"After a month and 10 days, when you buy a paralyzed headset, you can't hear it."
I'm generally pleased with the product and the delivery of tiki
- Packing and delivery secure.
"Headsets at a reasonable price should be fine, full bass."
"It's good, it's good, it's good, it's good for the price of the product."
"The quality of sound is fine, but it's usually broken in one ear."
I bought one of these for myself. <i>All right.</i> <i>All right.</i> <i>All right.</i> <i>All right.</i> <i>All right.</i> <i>All right.</i> <i>All right.</i> <i>This is what happened.</i>
"The earpiece has a certain, small, easy wear, and it's heard a lot of different kinds, but the sound doesn't sound good, and if you use common use like video chats or listening to English, you can listen to regular music, it's okay; the sound isn't very special, but if the need isn't high, you should also buy it."
"At first I was thinking about buying on Tiki, but I saw that on Sonycenter there was a free program, so I bought it, and I bought it before Christmas, and I spent some time using it, and I found that this was a quality of quality, a beautiful design, and I put it on my ears, and the quality of sound in my ears, and I got more mics, so it was good for talking and learning my English."
"It's important that I misread the C-door for an I.V., so I'd like to switch back the gate web out of L.A.?"
Fast wire charge even if you're sure to use it. Okay.
Tot
Wires make sure the main row is hard-loaded and fast supporting data transfers
Ok quick charge is satisfied at about 8/10
"The charge line OK, thank you shop and tiki."
"It's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good."
Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.
"It's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good."
"The charge line isn't too fast, it doesn't charge fast with some new iphone."
"The wire's thin, but it's very nice. Okay, quick!"
I haven't used it in a month. It's broken.
Mascius failed to get up at a time like a commercial.
Sic's completely cut through the tets.
TERRIA
"I've been wondering about the charge cup, and I've been following the 24-hour charge instructions, but the show mode is 80 percent, the shop is asking if the charge cup is a problem, or is it just the max that gets there not a full 100 percent, and I don't know if I'm full of blue or red lights, because I'm back in the blue?"
"Sounds with noise resistance are acceptable within range, hearing cells and weak cups, drop shorts, loose charge ports, buy once and probably not twice."
"The hearing ear is very short, or the battery is down, and the long use is earaches, only direct charge."
"Maybe I'm expecting too much for this piece of furniture, so I'm disappointed, the quality of sound of the product is a lot worse than the listening ear that connects 160."
"The ear can only hear one left or right, can't hear at the same time."
"Three months on one side, one side can't hear you, and you can't find the time-sharing information."
How do you know you're loading the batteries when you're in?
"It's either a call or it's an error, and it's in the box to get it back."
"Quick connection, nice form. Error product: right ear can only hear for about 30 minutes, trade for me, shop."
"Beautiful products, long-term batteries, sound quality, but they don't last."
I've got ms and SDs for a month and I've got an error in my ear. There's no hope for a repair shop.
It's beautiful. It's nice and it's nice and it's good and it's good and it's good and it's good and it's good and it's good and it's good and it's good and it's good and it's good and it's good and it's good and it's good and it's good and it's good and it's good and it's good and it's good and it's good and it's good for you
Sometimes lose blutut
"Sound sounds good, but mics don't work when they call, wait for the store to respond."
I can't hear you. I can't hear you. I can't hear you.
"I got it, but I can't use only the left earpiece, but I can't use the right earpiece."
There's no way in or out of the wire. We have to buy another wire.
There's one side to the ear. One side can't hear.
"Bad product, bring back the charge, charge it off the battery."
"The phaser connection isn't really smooth, and I can hear it for an hour, and the battery's 40 percent."
"The product sounds okay, but Micaro's very poor at talking to the shop for five days, but in fact, it's okay to check and then say that sp is not wrong if you want to pay 20 percent, so you're willing to lose so you don't have to get sp back without using the microphone."
"It's a little jumpy, but it's not working."
There's dust in the product.
Listen to the big side. It's boring.
I can't hear you with your left ear. I can't hear you with your left ear. I can't hear you with your ears.
"Left hand is not touchy, wants to trade shop"
"It's okay to listen to music. It's okay to call, it's okay, it's okay to call, it's okay, it's okay to call, it's okay, it's okay to listen to music, it's okay to listen to music, it's okay to listen to music, it's okay to call, it's okay to listen to music."
"More often than not, there's a lot of interference."
It's okay to use it. Put it in your hand a little bit.
"It's a little hard to use, but I'll get a signal when I don't."
"The battery's gone, and it's extremely easy to disconnect."
I've been using my ears for a month. One of my right-hand ears is broken.
"The earpieces in the box are too loose, so it's easy to lose the charge."
"It's normal for me to hear, but I don't know what's going on."
"The quality of sound is low, the waves are short on hearing, even though the phone stops to be next to it, the battery keeps charging 80 percent, the TIVI serves very well, doesn't protect the customers, always insists that the product is wrong, you shouldn't buy it."
Headsets are good. Copy that.
Pretty good at a price range.
Kkkkkkkkkkkkkkk
Your left ear can't hear you.
It's a bad idea to advise clients.
Batteries aren't exactly like ads.
It's not good. It's not good.
It's okay. The delivery's taking too long.
"The product is exactly what the ad is. Friendly delivery. Good sound quality, 10 meters connection of Bluetooth again."
"The battery's gonna be here once in a while. Come on, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go!"
"The hearing is fine, I don't hear all the time, but normally, it's been a long time, spending all week, and I still don't have to charge it, and the charge box is 50 percent."
"Small audio earphones, connected to dt iphones with short-term shorts, increased charge caps, unloaded..."
"The product has the right quality of the description, the package is solid, the delivery is fast, it's very expensive for P/s:"
"It's brilliant, the batteries are bigger than seven hours, and yet there's no sign of a battery. I just hear lessons, so I don't comment on speakers, but I hear very well, very sensitive. The price is 300k, and the quality is great."
"Headsets or excellences, easy connection, very smooth sound, as good as advertising, bought one more."
"listening after a period of time came strange and out of control signals such as automatic stopping while listening, automatic turning on siri, English sounds moved to the sound “Wicking of strange sounds, and connecting blutoohth and turning off constant connection! - Too bad!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"In the first few days of pain, I'm used to it."
"Good use, the shop has a very timely response to your questions! Good luck at the shop."
"When I hit the box, it was 91 percent, but my headset was fine, the battery was a long time ago."
"It's slow, it's slow, it's slow, it's slow, it's slow, it's slow, it's slow, it's slow, it's slow, it's slow, it's slow, it's slow, it's slow, it's slow, it's slow, it's slow, it's slow, it's slow, it's slow, it's slow, it's slow, it's slow, it's slow."
"The opposite earpiece of both ears, the left ear, the right ear, the left ear, the left ear messages, the employee just wants to ask questions, not to change the product, but the pager responds to the answer: “I think both ears are the same, I think they make earpieces with L and R for what they do, and I don’t know what's bad."
"The Bluetooth earpieces are true advertising, good, good to buy, sound good, wear good ears, good design, simple, very sure."
It's beautiful. Feel your head. Okay.
"Oh, my God, that's a great earpiece. It's a big, quiet shop. It's so corny. It's got some kind of touch on the box I've been listening to. It's been a long time."
"The quality is fine, the quality is fine, the music is reasonable, the left ear is strong bass."
That's good.
It's a good deal compared to the price.
"Right on the model, the prestigious store model is very focused on the quality of the product. Okay, the earpiece is very good. The cheap ear you're good at. People should try it."
"It's so sad, my family, to trust in people's evaluations to buy two."
"The quality of sound is poor -- well, the battery is still falling fast after you've followed your instructions -- pretty disappointed about the experience this time."
"Pack it carefully. I bought one three years ago, now support another."
"Good quality sound, fast connection, five stars!"
"New earpieces, sure, easy to connect, or, well, the shop is very nice and caring, caring customers, shops and text messages after you get the goods, and it's very kind."
"Right model. Celebrity store model. It's really good quality. Okay. It's very good ear, it's good ears, it's good ears, it's good ears, it's good ears, it's good ears, it's good ears, it's good ears, it's good ears, it's good ears, it's good ears for 5 stars."
"Five goes to a terrible buffalo battery, which sounds good, but it turns out it's kind of a bad call, and it's got a bad ear, but it's got two extra ears, and it's OK, it's a quick battery, because it's like a music bridge, so it's like five."
"The hearing is relatively fine, but what's called a ""print sensor"" is too bad -- it doesn't know what's the fingerprint and what's not the fingerprint to touch it -- in particular, it thinks that the pillow is also a fingerprint, so when you lean over the pillow, it turns off."
"Fine quality, however low charge battery, can only charge the earset once, the charge line is low quality, after a while use, the wire is loose, exposed to the inner core."
"A 100 percent battery, successful connection, but kcoa can hear the sound."
"The quality's fine, the distance from the walls will get the sound down, but you can still hear it, but when you use phone apps (mes,zalo,dis, etc.) it's kind of annoying when you accidentally touch the sensors."
Sound's fine.
"The touch feels to change the cards or to increase the volume that is slow but still available, the sound that is acceptable."
"No more batteries, no more batteries."
"The original sensory goods were quite pleased with the price and the aesthetics, but the quality was still there for the time to answer."
"Nice package, sure, speed delivery, new quality for a day, so I'll see you later."
He's got a very good earpiece. It's got a steady connection. It's very sensitive.
"- Quick delivery; - carefully packed; - deliver the right product; - easy use product, good quality."
"It's hard to connect, and since yesterday, the phone name has been displayed in the correct place, but the transplant failed. The box has been removable. The box should not be returned."
"Beautiful, powerful, handy, confident, sound quality, knowing the time of the battery, it's worth buying."
"It's not working, it's not working, it's not working, it's not working, it's not working, it's not working, it's not working, it's not working, it's not working, it's not working, it's not working, it's not working, it's not working, it's not working, it's not working, it's not working."
"It's cheap, but it's really cool, and I don't have ear pain, and I don't have a box to my ear like an image."
"It's the right model, it's the right quality."
"Nice model, quick delivery, well packed."
"The battery, it doesn't sound very good, but it's good for the price, it's far away, it's much longer than it's expected."
"The package is solid, beautiful, and exactly the friendly delivery model, fast delivery, earphones are good and sensitive."
"Six months to buy and very little to spend on their own batteries, charge them 100%, and then less than an hour is about 0%."
"It's a box full of accessories, nice earrings - bass is fine, while the movement's a little slippery."
"It's nice, but an acre can hear me. I can't figure out why I can't turn it on. I can't even get in, I can't get in, I can't get in, I can't get out, I can't get out of the top, I can't open the wool."
"The quality of sound is, I bought two sets of the same name, so it's kind of hard to distinguish fast delivery."
"It's worth a lot of money, batteries, listening to a day or two, using the first week to charge them twice."
"I bought it, and when I got it, it was full, but when I tried it, I could only hear one ear on the right, and I couldn't hear it on the left."
You can only use one side of me if you've just bought bugs.

"So the only thing that's left is the apple logo of the iphone x's that doesn't get into the center of the circle, but it also does, because the magnetic circle of the machine is in the middle."
"It's nice, it's close to the machine, the slots and the fit design buttons, it's not slippery, it's yellow or not, it takes some time to figure it out, it's best for the camera cuts to come up, so it's good to protect the camera."

"It's not true for the product, though it's changed twice."
"I'm not really happy about the product, but I think I'm a little bit over the words, and I'm kind of not paying attention to the name, and I'm just looking at the image, and that's all right with each other."

Okay.
No keyboard signals and mouse signals available to connect to the computer
"The connection is stable. But the keyboard and the mouse are both very hard, so the operation is very slow. The advantage is, however, that the package store is very well packed, the delivery is fast."
Mouse without pin to computer
"Mouse is running automatically. Mouse is closing data, hands are standing still. Mouse likes to go anywhere."
"It's small, it's not loud,"
"The sound is clear, the color's pretty good, and it's kind of great for shop one."
"The ears sound kind of good, or, strong, loud, for a long time, it sounds a little weird in the right ear."

"SP delivered fine, packed well, however slightly scratched exactly where the glass is, quite small, but in the lens position, I'd like the Shop to check harder on the SP for far-off forms because the customers can't change it."
"The package is broken, it looks very old, suggests Tiki's exchange of goods, recommends that the store check before it's delivered to the guests."
"Pretty, sure, the color for 10 points, fast delivery hasn't even been for 2 hours."
It's worse than it is.

The delivery was two days earlier than the initial notice system.
Beautiful little design with a good bass ring.
"The quality of sound or unexpected, thank you, tiki!"
"The Loca failed the volume button does not go down, does not work properly"
"High quality cap, negative sound, quality product, battery for a long time, wastes it all on its own before it's used, but the price of the product changes too rapidly."
"It's the same company holding hands, sounds good, it's stable."
"It sounds good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's within range."
"I'm not sure if anyone likes hard bass, but it's clear, and when you listen to pop ballad, don't listen to epic, you don't try to put it in the tub, but you don't have to try it, you just have to believe in the anti-water level of this product."
"Good packaged good, small design in the palm of your hand. Five stars."
"Buying 11-year-old girls music for fun, not expecting too much sound, but small speakers for martial arts, which is exactly what it is, that Tiki delivers so much for free that it's too fast to expect, package it carefully, it's brand new speakers."
"Good speaker, quick connection, fast transport."
"The demand for entertainment, the need to listen to music, the neatness to take it, the use time you don't know how to use it, the brand of goods, the need for good behavior, the need to pay for it."
"The real Ihas, which is a pretty good negative quality compared to the size."
"I've been using one for over two years, and I've recently come up with a stereo feature when I'm using a couple to buy more, and I've only got one minus speaker too light, and I've been playing hard bass, and I've got to be careful."
"Real goods, healthy batteries, listen to a few days' work, they're small but they're loud, they're unsympathetic, they're tight, they're tight, they're tight, they're tight, they're tight, they're tight, they're tight, they're tight."
"Nice design, fancy sound, reasonable price, only when you're getting distorted boxes."
"I just got the speaker. Tiki delivered the right color, the whole belt."
"It sounds good, the battery's long gone, but the connection's a little slow, so to close it, it doesn't make any sense why he can't connect."
"Lousy loud speakers, quality bass."
"Small, cute, good-sounding, loud, sharp, non-student, use of 01 days but satisfied!"

Sounds good enough...pin' long enough. Okay.

"It's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good."
"Anker's got a brand, little SP, sound good."
It sounds really good.
"Rating on the product: - tiki delivers the correct commercial - the sound quality of speakers that match the cost - speaker - consistent with music to the dance music, the bass is a little low on the CJC of tiki - with this one that you buy with another product of tiki, and after 10 days you don't have a reply when you're in touch with CSTC tiki, you're in general and then cancel your application after 10 days you're waiting for it."
The buffalo battery.
I'm very pleased with the quality.
"Good quality, sound clear, long-term battery"

"Good cover, super-like use."
"It's good for the money, the good looking, the loud sound material."

"Good stuff, excellent quality, good sound."
Good.
"It's very nice, I want to buy another one!"
It sounds a lot better than a speaker.
I listened for three hours and decided for five stars.
"Small design, long term battery, satisfied with sound 6W"
The delivery fits the description and the negative material is good...
"- The product is consistent with reading, hearing Buddhas, listening to English. - If listening to music is only at enough use. - The bass is somewhat inconsistencies. - the reverse corrections (compassioned by generation 1) are no support for listening to music from memory cards. - The rubber at the bottom holds good surfaces, not skimmed, but used one time as dirty as a form) - the design button at the bottom, which is much harder to press than one generation (a generation) then press along the top of the board with a good surface, which is not well fixed, fastly fixed."
"It's only been spent in August, but there's a problem with the warranty, and once the battery's charged, it's turned off once and then it's turned off, and next time it's turned on, it's gonna have to charge again."
"I can't connect with my computer's Mac System. Maybe it's because my Mac version isn't the latest, but it's not my confidence to upgrade Mac."
"The only subtraction point is the charge port is mini pd instead of typeC. After sd, the blues button does not work, instead the button that increases the volume turns on the double transplant mode."

"The battery can't charge, it can't start."
"What's wrong with the speaker? What's wrong with the speaker? What's wrong with the speaker, tiki?"
"The battery's a long time, but the biz doesn't sound good."

"You find a 360-degree speaker and you don't see it, you buy this one, and then you get an ad, and then you ask Tiki for air change:D."
"Nice pattern, quick delivery, good for the price."

"In short, there's two A and C gates, which are mostly available for phone lines, which have lights in the power, which are generally designed to be fully functional, so let's buy them."
"Watch the quality, sharp product, and after use it will further evaluate it."
"The product is properly described, certainly, the quality will be evaluated later."
"It's like water, whatever it is."
"It's a small, hard-held, hard-held, Type C gate for fast phones, and it's not hot, it's good, it's good, it's good to buy."
Okay.

"The dark screen, pasted to make the sensors ineffective, besides seeing, poor quality."
"Unquality goods, blur-glasses, break the screen's resolution and display the phone"
It's okay. It's all right. It's all right.
"The good keyboard at the right price of good looks, even though it's not sophisticated enough, the soft press, the right route, doesn't shout too loud, it's suitable to work in the office of the Good Ied, it can be changed through the private software of Logitech Point plus there's a lot of interactive keys with iCP, increase / volume, pause, play,... it's basically the average keyboard for you to experience your muscles, there's an Ied RGB. It's very good for the cost of the product."
"The hard, heavy black light is very strong. The background light can be transformed by the software of the company (LGBLING) button, no loud, no good sensitivity. compared with muscle keys, of course it's not equal but with others of the same range, I prefer it because the quality of the LPtech is better."
"The keyboard has a rather broad handbar, and the buttons for feeling very small, the spike is very good. As a result, the Mescarne keyboard should be a non-symlock, but it's in the form that has ears for medrine. The focus is that the noise when you have to work through the night is small. The layout of multiple media buttons is very useful. There is a button to turn off a keyboard and a keyboard switch to a game mode. When in game mode defaults such as Windows or buttons should not work very well. If you load more G-Hubs, you can also turn off other buttons, like the color lights or other keys for F1 to the F12. A lot more power extensions, even though your keyboards are very strong."
"The main product, the whole set of cables, the parachute cable, the Tiki delivery service, is fast, sooner than expected."
"The keyboard is carefully packed with quick delivery. After using it, the key key is very smooth. The key key is appropriate for working at night because it is sound when you type k key too loud. It is generally OK within this price range."
"I just ordered yesterday because the old keyboard broke down, ordered the tiki now, so this morning I got the goods, the goods, the goods, the keyboard quality I don't know how to use."
"If the fingers leave it, it's okay."
"The keyboard is quite sensitive, it's light-clicked. If you're using a normal keyboard, then you can start using this keyboard a little bit awkward because the keyboard design keyboard is in the middle. The keyboard is pretty close to sweat, dust. Led has to install new custom-reconform software (the default will change colors), the personal idea that Led will only make it better for nothing but power use. In general, this regular keyboard user with this standard quality worth using"
The product's okay.
"Light typing keyboard, beautiful design that combines multiple video functions, satisfaction"
"TikiNow makes a quick delivery, puts it last night, gets a row the next morning; the keyboard taps are light, LED lights are perfect for work at night; it's said you can configure the color of LEDs as you wish, but you don't have the time to test them."
"Quick delivery, nice pattern, fake buttons, but it's pretty cool."
"High sensitivity of keys is very consistent with games that manipulate your hand or play, soft wood sound doesn't have quite a smooth, beautiful ied that good effect, sums up better than your ex."
"Nice keyboard, by the way, looks good. The delivery is pretty fast, the new keyboard is good, it's good, it's good at the price, it's very good, you should buy it."
"Thank you, tiki."
"It's a bit of a mistake, but it's still a five-star drop."
Very fast delivery. Good keyboard.
"The keyboard is pretty good, nice. The muscle key, but when you press the muscle key, the sensitivity when you press the key is pretty good and smooth."
"Nice keyboard is definitely sensitive. It buys the moment, so it's really cool."
"It's nice, it's nice, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's for those who want to spend the negative."
Very good.
"It's so sweet, it's got all the colors, it's got all the keys!"
"Distinguished quite a while before buying this keyboard. For this price you can buy a keyboard that has a LED of other firms. However, since Fan of LPtech has been buying this keyboard for some time, add a lot of interest in Media, decide to choose G213. + G213 colors when you haven't turned on a BS lamp, because your keyboard design keyboard should be a poor contrast. Looking at black. However, when using a light lamp is very nice. Like that kind of carbuming card, you've never used any keyboard keys, but it's a good contrast. Lightness, lightness, lightness, and then you've got a good job at the same time when you're on your keyboard, and you've got a low on your keyboard, and you've got a low on your keyboard, and you've got a low on your keyboard, you've got a lot on your keyboard, and you've got a low on your keyboard, you've got a lot of your keyboard, and you've got a lot, you've got a lot on your keyboard, and you've got a lot on your keyboard, and you've got a lot on your keyboard, you've got a lot of your keyboard, and you've got your keyboard, you've got your keyboard, and you've got a lot of your keyboard, and you've got your keyboard, you've got your keyboard, you've got your keyboard, you've got your keyboard, you've got your keyboard, you've got your keyboard, and you've got your keyboard, you've got a lot of your keyboard, and you've got a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot to dot got your keyboard, and you've got a lot on your keyboard, and you've got your keyboard, you've got your keyboard, you've got a lot of speed, you's, you's, you's, you't got a lot on your keyboard, you't got your keyboard, and you've got your keyboard, you've got your keyboard, you't got your keyboard, you's, you's, you's, you's, you't got your keyboard, you't got"

I've been using it for a month. Feels good.

It's a real product like hang-and-sell.
"It took me a while to notice...... fast delivery, contribution to the beautiful keyboard, typing a little bit less than a muscle key. The color is able to adjust as you like to hear about water resistance without even trying......)"

"The order and payment are over 10 days and the application is still TILLIBERT? <i>The call to the operator is not back to the store, whereas the shopping site is still nine products.</i> <i>I've bought tiki several times and never been this slow, according to someone else's review, the time has come when tiki hasn't changed her way of doing things.</i> <i>Yes!</i> <i>That's right!</i>"
"The keyboard's fine, but it's very easy for a guy who's sweating to get a ball up like this, and I've only spent two days and I've got it."
The quality of the keyboard will be even more OK if the keyboard length has increased a little over the present time (the large human figure will feel a little tight when it has been used for a relatively long time)!
"Error keyboards, bought for a few days, broke the key, hit Shift + number to type special characters such as & # % out of another character. After two months type 1 2-3...... also cannot, out of the characters atouiei.... too bad."
"This keyboard, although it's a gamping keyboard, but I bought it for the purpose of programming, the office is less likely to play games. Therefore, my observation will be about speed and typing when I'm programming. On the outside, the delivery by tki is securely packed, delivered very quickly (in the last two hours). The product has a nice box, suitable for gifts if necessary. When I buy it, I try the speed of typing using the machine when I typer and the output of the machine is very good. The speed of typing on the machine is useful for the machine, because the machine's computer's computer's computer's skills are not very good enough to change, because it's a lot of the way to use the machine's machine's computer's computer's computer's computer's performance, because it's computer's computer's computer's computer's computer's computer's not going to use a lot of a lot of the time, because it's not a lot of a lot of a lot of the way that's not going to use that's machine's machine's machine's machine's machine's machine's machine's machine's a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of the way to work, because it's a lot of the way of the way, because it's machine's not going to work, because it's machine's machine's machine's a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of the way of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of the way of the way of the way of the way of the way of a lot of a lot of the way of a lot of the way of the way of the way of the way of the way of the way of the way of the way of the way of a lot of a lot of a lot of the way of a lot of the way of the way of the way of the way of the way of the way of the way of a lot of the way of the way of a lot of the way of the way of the way of a lot of the way"
"Just received the keyboard but saw the ""k"" key ""l""; ""m"", ""m"", """". There's another sound left and a click tag, so I'm not happy. Besides, the keys are pretty much okay."
I can use it for over a week. The H key doesn't eat. How do I communicate?
"I guess we don't play games right, so we buy the right ones, big ones, the right ones."
"Advantage: As you've observed, for your money, for your money's sake. Disabled: the size of each key is slightly small to the big-handed person, so it's easy to deflect or tap two keys at the same time because it's very sensitive and light."
"Use it for a week, space key doesn't click."
Advantage: - The key is so soft and sensitive that you don't need to use more force when you type. The scale between keys is comfortable when you type and rarely miss. The sound of the key isn't as big as you think. - The hard key is stronger than the impane keyboard.
"You know, when you let me take the third."
"smooth keyboard, quality"
I bought two or three months ago. I missed the key.
"If you're the one who's eating on the keyboard, you're missing this keyboard, you're breaking a Coke, and the keyboard is off-site for reasons to go into the water, you should consider before you buy a log stick."
My keyboard has been active for less than a month and has failed to use the B and space key.
"The big keyboard left the tight table, couldn't work."
"Get the goods but forbids access to an unregistered computer, has tried 3 unrecognizable desktops, keyboards not working"
I'm pretty good at playing inter-party keyboards.
"The product failed the T key, wanting to return the other product."
"double keys too much. Press one, put out two dds."
It's a pleasure to receive the package.
"When you bought it, you're stuck with your space keys."
"The key feeling is not good, but it's pretty quality, it's good to use it. The problem is that the keyboard doesn't have the LED color key to install newly adjusted software."
"At a price like that, quality's okay, can't be asked any higher."
Good.
The delivery's too long.
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

Nice watch. Good watch.
It's pretty OK.
The Shop is eager to trade goods.
"Buying an adult car with this one, getting a discount store, and we're happy."

Buying at the AMA store is a secure green.
The cheap price the watch uses is too good.
The installation manual is very enthusiastic.
Nice goods.
Pack your bags carefully. It's exactly advertising.
"Good product, quick delivery, so buy it!"
"Good use, quick delivery."

"The product's loud, the speaker's loud."
"Buy a pair, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good money."
"Good use, easy use"
"It's beautiful. It's not installed yet, and it's not considered very much."
"Five for the product and the price, the money combined, the quality ok"
"I'd like to buy another one, what's your offer, shop?"
"Good Shop, so buy two watches. Good use."
It's extremely satisfying.
Use it very well. Okay.
That's great.
Buy the second one that's missing a screw tie.

Okay.
I'm satisfied with the two watches I bought.

"It's nice, it's cheap, but it's really hard to get rid of the sim, and it doesn't match, and there's no way that the huobgws could be used in pure language, so we don't know how to set the date properly."
"If we don't get sim, we'll have to run to the store and re-make new sims that we can't use."
"It's good to use it at a price range, but it sounds a little small, and it used to buy something that ended up in the washing machine, so it's time to buy this for a little bit."
"Use photos. Shop for instructions on how to use it, but not how to install it."
"The sim machine, running around town for days, buying sim, triggering no paper packs. 30/40k, pack 120k/thag, put sim in there. If you can't answer it, save the phone book, then put it in the box, you don't get it."
"No visual calls found yet, a good judgment feature on the price."
It's good. It's good. It's good for expenses.
"The clock doesn't set the timer, it doesn't call, it just listens, the sim card is hard, it shouldn't be bought."
It's been pretty good to try more. The background has not been changed.
Lap sim doesn't have parallels.
"The clock lines are torn, sp's too bad to sell, no hearts, no disappointments."
"It's temporary, but when you're connected to the phone, there's no QR code on the back, thanks for the guide shop."
"You don't know how to put the sim back on, you can use it, you can't talk to the shop, you can't talk to them, you can't talk to them, you can't talk to them."
"It's extremely unsatisfying, it's a lot of difference, it's four o'clock, it's short time to talk, it's no time, it's no time, it's no time, it's no time to talk, it's no time to talk, it's no time to talk, it's no time to talk, it's no time to talk, it's no money, it's no money, it's no time to leave."
"Unquality goods don't work as advertised, can't connect four hours to the shop, ask questions over and over, and then stop judging one for quality and service attitude."
"Tell sim 4G to come along and don't see it, and if you put another sim on it, the clock won't get sim."
Disabled auxiliary functions to limit battery use but is still running fast. It is difficult to connect 4g
"I can't set the time. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm not setting up a position like a commercial. I'm kind of disappointed."
"It's been broken, it's been sent over and over again, it's not okay to send it back and forth."
It's 4 o'clock and there's not a shop wave that only sends a ghost and a k.
The clock I received didn't have the Code QR code.
"The battery's a little weak, the basic quality of conversation, the anti-water resistance isn't standard ip67, the color bt display."
"The clock's dead, it's loaded for her to take to school, she's gone at the beginning of the afternoon!"
"The damaged product does not have to be used as a time return procedure, but it is supported by a quick return."
"Because of the technical incident, there's no real experience, so for the next three stars, we're going to evaluate the details later."
"The camera's a little fuzzy, the location's not accurate, the delivery's fast."
No use yet. I don't know if it's good. I'd like to show you how to install the date.
"Toys, unlike foxes, fires"
It's okay.
"It's just been bought a few times. We can't charge the batteries now, we can't use them right now."
"It's not good, it's not good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good."
"First of all, it's a little hard to activate."
Buy two that should have delivered two charge lines with one charge.
The battery doesn't work in two days. It's gone. It's very unhappy.
Okay.
"Call me one week, call me. I can't hear you. You can't talk to a shop, you can't answer. You can't answer a service that's too bad."
I've been putting the sim together for a long time.
The charge's been down for a week.
I'm fine.

"The product's fine, but the battery's running fast."
It's only been two weeks.
The clock does not have the registration code even though the sim is installed
That's a bad call. I don't think I'll buy it again.
Go back and install the sim and not get on the iTunes.
What kind of sim do you need to put in?
"The timer is easy to install and use, but the baby that she has spent the last two weeks has been cut off on one side."
"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."

Positioning at a time is not boring.
"Quick delivery, enthusiastic counsel."
It's not good to be so generous.
"It's okay not to use the pattern, but the quality's not as good as expected, the battery's weak."
Small volume

Good at price range.
"It's not right, but it's gone fast. It's been six hours. It's not exactly positioned, it's a 600 meters error."
I can't hear a word I can't change. The mic can't get a call from the other side.
It won't activate sim!
"It's normal, it's all right, it's all right, it's all right, it's all right, it's all right, it's all right, it's all right, it's all right, it's all right, it's all right, it's all right, it's all right, it's all right, it's all right, it's all right, it's all right."

"The quality of the product is good. Read, mark sensitive pictures. Thank you, shop."
"Using so much, it's not possible to evaluate quality yet."
"It's exactly what's on the card, the fast format, the solid image."
It's for use to know.
The product works. Okay.

Wrong delivery type type type of description
"I don't think we've talked about any kind of quick delivery now, but we've got new ones, new ones, new ones, new ones, say three times!"
"High quality sound in a light 9mm stereo design with light design, bringing powerful low-stiming sound and high-stiming sound. Mic and wire control on wires to make free-handed calls, free-handed calls, and moving songs without ever having to touch your smart phone, thanks to the mic and the control on the wire. The stress has to design your teeth to break and break and to hold your ears, keeping your ears unbuttoned. 4 pads size (S), and M), you can easily choose the size of your music."
"Tiki delivers as quickly as possible, packed carefully, and finished all day. :) The sound is warm, the bass is fine, the volume is high, a product of quality compared to the price."
"If you buy Sony's goods, you can rest assured, I usually use them when I'm running, it's worth a lot of money."
I'm just buying a box of paper. There's a warranty ticket in the box that's missing the quality of time to come back here and comment.
"Pack the product properly, seal on the hard paste box at all times: the warranty and accessories, sharp sound, consistent with the price of the money."
"The headsets are good, they're clear, they can come back next time."
"I love hearings, I'm very happy with the product:3 I remember it so I didn't ask for it too high or professionally, so I feel like this kid used very well."
"That's why I don't ask for too much in detail, sound sounds fine, mics catch sound good, perfection from sony."
"It's nice, it's color, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's color, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's color, it's good."
"Sony's earpiece, which sounds great, sounds really good, doesn't break or make any noise."
"Fast delivery, carefully packed goods, soft, soft sounds."
"The main product, the quick delivery, the outside box is a bit of a moving box, the wrap-up of the tape, the break-in, the luck is the ear box is still sealed."
"Put the tiki now, pick up the package faster than expected! <i>The full warranty card.</i> <i>I'm in love with Jack.</i> <i>I'm in love with him.</i> <i>I'm in love with him.</i> <i>I'm in love with him.</i> <i>I'm in love with him.</i> <i>Let's go.</i> <i>I'm in love with him.</i>"
"The sound of quality is far superior to the price, except the wire is a little thiner and longer than the earpieces are quite different."
"The sound of quality, the delivery on time, the tiki checking, always makes the customer feel secure."
"I'm buying my silver headsets. It's okay. The first time I bought my earplugs, it's kind of weird. Sounds good."
"Nice package, good form, test quality to find out."
"Although it's been a long time, it's been said that the right quality for a coffee shop works that is too crowded and noisy to focus on hearing and listening to music to work with people who demand high sounds that the ear is just enough for price and quality."
"The quality sounds good, it doesn't ring, it feels like hearing a speaker, it doesn't have a earache, it's kind of thin, and this time tiki delivers her delivery."
"The book gives us a better understanding of the ego of people, the self in every object that is labeled identical to us..."
"It sounds better and more comfortable than AMG goes with Note 10 and I use it through adapter USB-C through 3.5 and I plug it directly into S9+ and it sounds good, it's also nice, it's not neat, I let it look even better in black and white."
"The earlobe is much smoother than the sound of a S10+ plus (this is the size of a person's ear). The sound is much easier and the sound is better for you, learning to listen to English every day (this is also your custom). It's a simple but cheap package, but there's no pockets, but there's also a tool that wraps the length of the box very well."
"Nice headsets, good sound, everybody."
Quality's fine. Each one's too small and soft.
"The sound is fine. The balance sound is not as weak as the bass is, it's honest, it's doing the job and it's conveying the content of the song. Anyone who sees the bass is weak by not putting enough deep into the ear tube or choosing the wrong size."
"I'm kind of a bull's ear type, so I don't have a lot of feedback on negative matter, and I don't have ear pain, and the main product, so it's reassuring, fast delivery (from Hanoi to province in a day). The only difference is the price of the product, I've looked at a few other websites, not 390k left in 390k, but it's not worth subtracting from a star of the product."
"Four stars for the product, one so that the total price of five stars is so good or so soft that the bass is so soft that it can listen to the various Treds of the Treb, it can't be compared to the EXCACP, but it's much easier to hear than XB55AP, because the bass doesn't overdo too much."
"I've already paid for the quick delivery by myself, and I've got a full package for the cargo stamp in general that's brand-new, and the discounting code for the payment is 254K is too cheap."
"I'm putting my blue headphones from Tiki Trading. The delivery is early, shipper 5* There's no picture of me being a little lazy about my hearing: - Button:"
"The ear is pretty good at the price range, and it's smoother than some of the same size, and there's a lot of suck for those of you that have different ear size, and if you just plug it in and turn on the negative max, it's going to be a little bit shy, and it's going to be gone."
"This Sony's product is really impressive, it's beautiful, it's not slippery, it's even neat, it's small, it's light, it's soft, it's negative, it's nine millimeters, it's comfortable, it's totally expensive."
"Buying the right salad so the price is reasonable,ship fast, every shipper's behavior is not good because of fluids. You're a little stressed out. You bought it for me. And I love it, it's easy to wear, it's not bad, it's good to hear, it's good to buy, it's good to buy, it's good to buy, it's good to buy."
"Good quality product, fair price, quick delivery."
"Headsets are good, Sony, full product, quick delivery."
"All of Tiki Trading's products, however, I've been buying from Tiki for a long time."
"Pack your bags, quality product, three extra little underwear, warm sound, no ear pain."
"Fast delivery, friendly shipper, earpieces, smooth, small, sufficient accessories, the whole set of wires is a bit fragile, the sound sounds good, the bass is strong, clear."
"Tiki's the best, the real product doesn't have to roll, the travel's super fast, it's incredible."
"The product is brand-new, brand-new, low-cost but low-cost compared to the center of Sony, which includes a warranty slip in the bottom of the box, packaged it well enough, sound good enough, but sure or 10 times as little as the ear that comes with the phone, the color that you're supposed to buy in the bottom of the box, but Tiki Trading wasn't pink, so you can pick me up black, and you're going to see how black it is? For a while you're waiting for more pink, because it's so beautiful."
"The delivery was super fast, only booked last night, which the next morning was delivered, and the earphones were pretty good, and they didn't have a earache, so they weren't sustainable."
"The main product, still intact, delivered fast for five stars."
"When you buy an earpiece at this price, you actually have no hope of anything more than choosing Sony's product to expect a sound level that's not so bad."
"Don't worry about using Sony's product, it's perfectly sound! Pack it carefully, sweet shipper, will continue to support Tiki"
"Sound and sound against good noise, quick delivery, carefully packed and sure."
"Tiki delivers very quickly, beyond her expectations, and despite my hearing, I've been throwing it away, but it's pretty sure, so far, it's still not broken, and the sound of my ears is pretty good at this price, and I'm buying white, but it's not as easy as people say."
"Good earproof hearing, given two pairs of pads, sound quality fine compared to price."
"I bought the second one, the first one from 205, enough to know how good it is, and I'm in love with Sony."
"Thursdays, Friday afternoons, the product has nothing to complain about, and I've bought the feds, and I've got a lot of goods on Tiki, and I've never had a technical incident or a complaint, and I'm quick, and I'm good, and thanks to Tiki."
"It's not debate, it's great, it's negative, it's good bass, it's especially no ear pain, there's bad yellow wire, there's bad brass, there's a ban on hearing and there's beautiful yellow, there's a shadow."
"Good sound, suitable at price range"
Good sound...
"The earpiece is beautiful, quality is fine, but this time it's a little late for delivery, but it's still five stars."
I put tikinow on a super-speed delivery for an hour?
"Thank you, shop and tiki."
"I got the goods very quickly, I got the packaged, I got the goods, I got the colors, I got the goods, I got the goods, I got the loud and clear sounds, I got my orders to learn my English and listen to my music, I bought the goods, I got the checkouts, I got 40,000 down, and I love ordering electronics, books over the website, and I bought online Tiki."
"The real falcon, the product of tiy ty ty tyquiding, is confident, the long wire, the plastic board for you to wrap up, and it's appropriate for you to need long earlaces."
"It's like breaking the wire, and even though looking at the thin wire, it's just regrettable for a while that it's going to be hard down there, and it's going to break even though it doesn't have a negative effect, but I'm pretty good on this sample at a price."
"Nice color, sounds very good at this price. The delivery is fast."
The package is solid. It's still sustainable. Let's see what happens later.
"Quick delivery, neat, polite shipper tiki, happy and carefully packed ear, with HDSD, and a review of the quality."
"It's fast, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good."
"I'm happy about my product, my ears, my ears, it sounds good, the quality of the store on tiki is off the table, Vote for the 5-star shop, super fast delivery."
"Tiki delivers fast, ears don't even try sound, but it's generally OK within the price range."
"The good design, the good noise resistance, the great quality of sound."
"Quick delivery, packed, but it's kind of dirty, but I'm glad I bought it, so it's okay, it's okay, it's good, it's loud and it's full of ears so I don't have ear pain."
Good.
"It's a small product, it's a good sound, bass's a little weak."
"The earship as fast as the wind, sound warm, appropriate for listening and meeting online"
"Phones sound warm, nice packaged, coloured as ordered."
"I've got a lot of perk on my ear, so it's a great deal, but it's pretty good against noise, but it doesn't seem like it's going to fall off, but it's a good sound, although I'm not very good at it."
The average quality sounds fine.
"The package is careful, will continue to support the long shop."
It's very quick and very good.
Black wire used to be good. foot is 90 degrees to block the wire in this position
It's pretty good.
"Good quality, I can use it on the laptop, and it says that it's for smartphones to do the luvs, my head to throw away for a while."
"The sound of your ear is so good, the color of your ear is so good."
"Thank you, tiki and the shop for the quality product."
"High performance, good quality. Good quality. Good quality."
"The sound sounds pretty good, the bass and the bamboo sound is clear and more than the ones we bought before, the bolero or the heavy music is good, maybe because the price of this is higher, so the quality is better than the previous."
"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
I don't like it with the old one.
"Sound sounds good, microphone against noise, okay?"
"Tiki delivers super fast and yesterday, got the goods today."
"It's a good sound, compared to the price of money, plus a lot of easy-to-use underwear."
"Good product, quick delivery."
Sounds good.
"Sound clear,"
It's like the exchange store next time will back us up.
"It's very smooth, people. it's been a while, but it's worth it."
"It's pretty good. If you put on your headset, you're going to lose a lot of noise on the outside."
Satisfaction
"The bass's fine, I've spent three years listening well, maybe longer if I didn't break my hand in a wire, which is worth the money I bought."
"I don't know, I don't know!"
Quick delivery. Very good quality.
"Use ok, sound bass good, eat a few meals it's still very nice to have hfjkf kfjkkkkkkkkjffb kfd"
"Quick delivery, friendly staff."
"The bass ear's fine, the company's main."
"The earpiece is very good, worth the price."
"Good sp, thank you."
"Listen, Bass is fine, listening to EDD music is too good, we've been spending a lot of time and we still haven't seen any low-level sound."
I don't know if tiki's gonna last 12 months.
"Good use, sound clear, talk mic's fine."
"Pack it up carefully, full of company accessories: three-size sucking, a wire wrapr to narrow it down, narrow, sure, sound good."
"Sounds good, sounds good, colors good."
It's warm. It's nice.
We're good. We're good. We're good.
Sony lines say they're not talking about quality.
Quality headset
Quick delivery and quality must be used to find out
"With the money I spent, I'm satisfied with the product."

"I used to buy this product in 2019, and I loved the box, and now I'm missing out, and inside the paper box is a thin plastic bag, which is different from the one on the left."
"Some of you say that doesn't sound big because it doesn't match the company, but on the sd guide you don't know how? <i>The amount of time you have to be able to check out, hope for long.</i> <i>The box is the paper box.</i> <i>You're sure to be able to point to your lips, and you'll still like it in the plastic box, and you can hear it better when you're in the plastic box.</i> <i>It's the time you have to control of your arms.</i> <i>The amount of time you'll be able to do it.</i> <i>The time you'll be able to do it.</i> <i> <i>You'll be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do it.</i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i>It'll be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to get through</i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i>If</i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i>I can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to"
"I put my ears in blue, but the light blue exchange shop, and the label is blue, whereas the price of blue is higher than pale blue, and the price is about tens of thousands, so it doesn't matter very much, it's important to advertise and deliver more prestigious."
"The products are good, the sounds are vivid, they're worth buying at a price."
"The hearing ear is fine, the cost is low, the request is high, the sound is good, the sound is good, and the voice is a bit low, Tiki trading superships early than an hour p.m. There's a shock!"
"Here's the third one I bought, the earpiece's pretty easy to cut off on one side, the one I can use for one year, the one I can use nearly a year later, this one with a nice paper box, but this one with a dirty looking box, the one where the feeling is still soft, the one with the black one I just cut off with the one that I just bought, and the one with the one that I just bought, it's probably because the price went down. (The second one bought 390K), bought the third one because I liked this design of my ears."
This is the second one I bought... the first one to get into the box is very decent. This second one is 100% open?
"I ordered it from September 24th, but until 2th of October I received it, you deliver it in exactly one hour, blackpink out new Mv, which I'd love to hear as soon as you hear it with your new headsets."
"First, I'm not happy about the Tiki delivery service, but the first time I ordered one, but the delivery was too long, then it was unintelligible, while I didn't get any delivery calls from shipper, but when I ordered the second time, the delivery was faster, so I missed it, and then the next thing I did was about this earbuds."
"Your product's ears have been timid in your left ear while you've been using it for more than a month, and I've bought a safety package that uses 12 blocks to get it back."
"Use it at this price range, audio mics. OK, but we're taking it background again."
"Putting the delivery system now in front of 20 minutes until noon on the 22nd of July, calling the operator, saying, ""Where are the delivery, hold on."" People give money to tiki now, but they get regular transactions. People need to put now, tiki's doing bad business, they don't have time to deliver it, they don't have time to give it to people, they don't know how to respect it."
"The earpiece fits within the price range, the low sound, and the wire is slightly thin, using it accordingly to study and listen to books, listen to music, and watch movies without hearing."
"The product's been scratched through a lot of boxes, and the papers are stuck inside."
(Laughter) (Laughter) (Laughter) (Applause) (Applause) (Applause)
"I'm getting a delivery now. I'm getting pretty good on the phone, but I'm talking to my computer, and I'm getting greek, so what's wrong with the other ear plugs that I'm doing with my computer?"
"I've only observed the sound: the full, unscheduled bass is the only thing in the world; the sound is not warm, the sound and the music is not true, the higher it is, the higher it is, listening to the music without lyrics and the music that doesn't have feelings, and after I get the mornings, I listen so boringly, I go to the hearing at night, I buy the Q7NI ear for 105K, and it's better than that."
"It's not 100 percent new, it's like a long-term storage package, it's a lot of dust, it's not fresh, it's not as new as the one we bought from the cellphones, it's pretty painful, it's not as good as the one we bought, it's not as good as the one we bought, it's not as good as the one we bought, it's not as good as the one we bought, it's not as good as the one we bought, it's not as good as good as the one we bought as the one we bought."
"I've always trusted Sony's line of sound products, but this isn't what I expected."
"I read the product description and review said the bass was good, but when I got the bass was bad, the high notes sounded really bad, and I've been having earache, and I've used Sony's headphone before, but I don't think that this time I'm not going to buy Sony's product twice."
"Tiki delivers it quickly and with its stamps, and it takes more time to evaluate it, and it's pretty green, and it's very rare."
"At the end of the rainy day that Tiki's shipper is still very enthusiastic about his ears: quality is fine, he's well packed, he's got more ears to change, he's got 3D and 8D music, the bass's fine, the next time we're going to buy it."
"I bought a birthday for my sister, I said good earrings. However for a copy of the tikinow delivery service, 1. I'm paying tikinow on June 12, and I'm being told that I'm going to deliver my sister's 13 (or my sister's birthday) yet shipper calls me three consecutive calls me three times in a row."
"I don't have earphone experience, so I've got a firm, and the price's been pretty good, and I've been good, and I don't have a box, and I don't have it in my bag, and I don't have it in my pocket, and I don't like it, but I don't like it, but I can't see it, and I don't have it in my ears."
"Even though you've been using your ears for a month now, you've probably burned everything that's fine, but you can't get your ears up, you can't get your ears up, you can't hear them, you can't hear them, you can't hear them, you can't hear 'em, you can't hear 'em, you can't hear 'em, you can't hear 'em, you can't hear 'em, you can't hear 'em."
"I get the product pretty fast, I get the color right, I get the look."
"I'm not happy about the tiki service, I'm ordering with tiki now, the notice system for 18 o'clock, to over 19:00 without contact, to call the support center, but not to know how it's going to work, not to know when I'm getting anything."
I bought these ears twice in blue and I know what it's like to be the right color.
"Compared to the actual price ( Buy) acceptable quality product, however Tiki should set an exact price. The value of the product's site is only 390 k, not 690 k. Note that additional arrays should be used carelessly. The price of the company's site is 390 k, not 690 k."
The rest of the product is quality ok
"If you've ever heard of high quality headsets, it's like spending money nearby to buy the word ""Syny."" It's not about buying the quality of hearing. It's not about hearing quality, it's about hearing, it's not about hearing, it's about hearing, it's about hearing, it's about quality hearing, it's about quality."
"I just got out of here yesterday, after a day of playing music, and today I'm hearing again, and I can hear quite a bit, and I can't hear it, so I can't hear it, so I just feel it's convenient to carry it out and nothing is better than an earpiece."
Sound has no quality compared to the price of money.
"Take your earphones off your ear carefully because your ear pads are so easy to slip, you've lost your ear pad when you've just used them and you don't know when to fall out of your ear, but I don't see this hearing sound as good and as tight as my old jbl t210."
"I'll put blue, but I'll give it to you."
"I bought it to hear you and to listen to music, so it's okay. it's just a little bit of a fight, it's not like I'm expecting it."
"The earpiece reduces the noise outside, no earaches, and the earpieces aren't broken when it's wrapped up, they're worth buying."
China's 150K low quality of sound. It's because it's so boring.
"The sound is boiling, the sound is breaking, it's listening to the music gently."
"The tip of the ear is smaller than any other product, which sounds at an acceptable level, expecting nothing more than this price."
"It's the same color, but it's a little light outside. Quality isn't too high. You shouldn't expect too much. If you need a full headset, you've got enough bass, you've got 400K."
"Put the blue on the green, and when you buy it fast, and when you change it for a long time, I don't know if you'll ever be able to change it, I can't stand it. I'm not happy with the tiki way of selling it."
"I mean, I'm a little nervous, but I'm just a little bit shy."
"So there's no picture of me using a higher form of life, so I don't have to think about it."
"This is the second time I've bought this product, it's okay, it's fully packed, and the next time it's too sketchy, the next time it's the product quality, it's okay for me not to change it."
"At first I bought a little bit of ear pain, maybe it's been a long time since I heard inears, but at the price, I listened to music, played games, talked, and the sound of games was as clear as the sound of feet, horses running or screaming."
"Fast delivery, quality good, but the wire's a little thin."
"Tiki delivers for a long time, and the hearing is okay, sometimes not both sides, but as long as it takes time to find out."
"Put it in dark blue, but deliver it in pale blue. If you run out of dark blue, don't let your customers choose it, you buy it, you deliver it cheaply."
"The product I got was in a paper box, which wasn't like the transparent box in the picture."
The ear I got back in the paper box?
"Well, it's a pretty good negative. It's not gonna take a long time to evaluate, but at 378K, it's not much to ask for anything else."
I bought 300K headsets that you gave me a box of paper like 30K earpieces. Sony is a brand-new product that Tiki delivers as contempt for customers.
"After six months of using it, one of my earpieces doesn't hear very well."
"It's not so good, it's not so good, it's clear, bass is weak, it's better for you than for you to hear music, but at this price range it's okay."
Set Jewel Blue
"That's nice, but it's not good enough. And the deep pass isn't there yet."
"The only thing that's so thin, it's so thin, it's broken, everything's okay."
I think it's okay to just attach the tape to the adapter wire.
"The bass earpiece is stable at a price range, but the wires are a little rough, the delivery is not exactly as the delivery schedule is supposed to be, and for the first time being two days late, I hope Tiki never repeats the situation."
Why can't the control button be used? Don't get set up yet.
"The bass is good, but it's hard to tell the difference between the sound direction, and the job is definitely cool!"
"I think the product's missing the coiled suly, but is there any way the Shop could have sent me that?"
"Transportation too long, quality too normal. It's kind of disappointing."
"Why does my box shell look so old, stamps in the paper box for publication and maintenance are in 2017? And the quality will take a while to figure it out."
"The ear sounds good, sounds warm, for 4 seconds, because the original price is 390, and this price is up to nearly 700, but if it lasts forever."
The order is 289k and delivers 292k... and the order is shaved... and it's very unhappy.
"The strong bass ear, the strong bamboo, the weak mid, the phone plug, is fine, but in a laptop, there's a noise that can't be adjusted."
"Regarding sound: + Bass sounds very deep, the bamboo is very detailed: I'm very pleased with the sound of the device. For appearance: + the rubber button is very soft, the wear is very comfortable. + compared to the Audio-Plainica ATH-CK3iS product, the device is smaller, the ear wire is smaller, the wire is thin, the ear is still a slight problem. + The wire of the device is the only parts that you don't like to hear because the part of your ear is so it's very sensitive and it feels good."
That's a terrible sound. That's worse than Note 9.
His headphone doesn't have a box like a description. The paper box's pretty loose. His earpiece's pretty thin. It sounds good.
"However, the delivery's attitude is too bad, and he's willing to round up the order to stop the customers' money."
It's getting bigger and bigger and bigger and deeper and deeper to hear the bass sound too bad.
The mic doesn't work after a while.
"It's a lot better than an iPhone wire, but the wires are too thin, too small, the wires on the wire and the iodine."
ok judkksksisisissisdhsudjsjs
It took me a while to find out how thin the wire looks.
"Fast delivery, beautiful headsets, excellent quality of headsets, slightly weak bass."
"The right price, hear less bass sound, wear deeper earpieces, see the bass sound better."
"The pattern OK, the sound is good, just use it to see how strong it is."
"I bought my ears for 290K, and I used them as well as the price, and notice that the wire is a little small, and it's easy to cut, so it's going to lift a little hehe."
"The quality corresponds to the cost of money, which for months has not been cut yet."
"There's something special that's compatible with every device from pc, laptop, iOS and Android."
"The temporary quality is OK, the minus point is K has a tone-up button,"
"I love Sony's headset, satisfied with the product, quality, delivery time, but I really hate the delivery attitude!"
The headset's too loud.
"A week later than expected, the product is too expensive."
"Can't hear an ear, fast delivery."
Tiki's delivery services are always pleasing and reassuring to the quality of the goods.
"Pleased with the product, tiki delivers fast, carefully packed, quality of hearing OK, how long does it take to find out over time?"
"A super-slow bass commercial that sounds boring, no depth at all, just good noise resistance."
"The right sound for one who enjoys listening to all kinds of music, the right price for Tiki’s discount."
"This time, it was so disappointing, the sound of hearing was very loud, there was no bass."
Power lost a lot of SONY XB55AP
It's a nice package package. It's a good quality. Sound's normal. Acceptable within the price range.
The headset's good. It's got a nice piece of plastic.
Nothing zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
"Jack's ear is messed up, plugs at a time."
"Quality is fine compared to price, sound quality is normal, not remarkable."
"Nice design, big brands, but listening to music is worse than listening to the movie S10."
It's a long way from 18 to 26 before you've got any goods.
"All right, listen to the music loud and clear."
"I've been buying headsets for over a month and a half, and today I've been getting my head down, and I'm not as good as I was when I bought it."
I'm not sure what it feels like.
Just to listen.
"Whatever it is, yggdgddddd."
"Good noise resistance, radio quality. Okay, but the mic's a little too far from the mouth."
"The box sent to distortion outside contains broken rows that fill the cover, with no shock plastic covers"
"I ordered it on August 31,2018, which is 450,000 on September 6,2018, and it's down to 39 million. So what if I want to buy the goods until the lowest discount?"
It's normal to be a little shy sometimes.
"The package's fine, but it doesn't look like much in the picture."
Packed...
It's beautiful. It's not so special.
"You know, the fast delivery type we ordered the t2 that the t4 had delivered early one day."
Okay.
The wire is thin compared to the price.
"It's so delicious, it's so soft. It's so delicious."
"His ears don't believe a word, he's looking for a cave, he's looking for it, he's looking for it, he's looking for it, he's looking for it, he's looking for it, he's looking for it, he's looking for it, he's looking for it, he's looking for it, he's looking for it, he's looking for it, he's looking for it."
"fake shouldn't buy, not like other rate people."
The wire is not exactly what you expected it to be.
"If you can use a tp, you're gonna get a signal that you can spin, bt."
"It's so disappointing to hear only one side, I hope that tiki will give it back to me."
"I just got an earpiece this morning, quality's okay, but I'm not getting a bag of cloth, so I'm kind of disappointed."
"The earpiece is good within the price range, likes the bass that's good enough to hear from you."
good quality
"It's a good product, it's a fair price, it's a pretty good quality."
"The product's too boring, it doesn't match the price."
"It's a bit of a gharial, temporary nc-sharp product."
Don't ever make me judge again.
"Small sound, bass isn't deep enough."
yellow looks as old as used
"It's okay, it's okay. It's okay, it's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay."
"The quality's good, the sound's good, the ear's clear, clear and certain."
"The hearing ear buys for a month, ears can hear, ears can't hear."
"The hearing ear is good, the pattern is nice, the defect is pretty thin, so it needs to be preserved."
"Good sound, design doesn't seem certain."
"It's a bit loud when the speaker goes loud, but it's not what it's supposed to be."
I can't hear the ear. I can't hear the ear. I can't hear the ear.
Is that a bad sound or is bass timid?
headset's good. long-term endurance waits. good delivery.

"The sound's pretty good, a little too bassy, relatively good."
It's not in the bass yet.
"The product gets the same image, the quality is OK at a price range but the wires are long, thin and easy, the delivery is fast and the package is well packed."
Put the blue... the green... the sound is normal... normal...bassin... generally is like the earpiece of his experria X.
That sounds great.
Heard at a price range.
That sounds good for nearly 300k.
"It sounds good, it's clear, it's vivid, but if you don't have the conditions, you should buy it."
The sound doesn't sound good.
The product's fine at the price.
Good enough
"And compared to the price of money, the quality of not being good, the quality of not being warm, the sound of not being warm, the ear of hearing 100k back down."
"It's a bit timid, bass isn't sure, but it's not a high price."
Headset's on the line.
It's good. It's good. It's good.
"This isn't the first time we've used Sony earpieces of this kind, and the sound and mics are better than some of the others."

"The earpieces don't go through, they don't go through, they don't go down, they don't design bad, they don't sell goods, they don't change goods, they suck."
The product doesn't look like the seller's introduction.
It's the end of the speaker. It's too small.
"The left earpiece didn't work, and I tried to charge the battery and connect with other devices; it didn't work."
"Your hearing ear is not sensitive, you touch your ear, you can't get your call, you can only hear your ear, you can't connect very slowly, you can't reach your ear."
"About, let's try it without a test star battery, which comes from yesterday afternoon to today's not full of batteries, and we can't get a Bluetooth on the phone."
"It's not the real product, it's not the perfect quality, it's the sound, it's the volume, it's the volume of the battery, it's going to go down as fast as time, you shouldn't buy, you shouldn't waste money."
"The ear only hears one right, the other is not."
Pretty good at the price.
It's a type-c charge charge charge where the mini drive lines are wrong to charge.
Sound: 7/10 Design: 8/10 Experience: 6.5/10 utility: 8/10
It's not as weak as 10 meters. It's a nice product code. It's a nice package envelope.
The sound quality is normal.
I can hear the big side on the small side of the battery. It's too fast.
What's the money?
"Bad quality product, large ear ears on the small side"
The day's work is over.
The item's not working as good as the package.
"One hears you, and the ear can't be light."
It's pretty good. We're pretty happy.
"We've got a bug in the ear, we've got no battery."
The sound's gonna lose tens of thousands.
"The product doesn't have a bass. Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go."
Fine.
It's okay.
A small volume headset.
"The sound's shy, it's cut off, the battery's been on it for a long time."
Bad hearing quality.
I'm fine.
We're good. We're good. We're good.
I'm so disappointed in TiKi's sales.

"It's extremely satisfying to have the product that's exactly the same as the description, the package is solid, it's very expensive, it's fast delivery."
"Well, quality, we've been using for a couple of months is still very reliable, and we've always supported tiki, the shop."
"Nice form, temporary sound. You can't expect low ear, deep bass."
"That's very smooth, very quick delivery."
Good quality delivery at a high price will hurt your ears.
That sounds good.
"Perfect, sure, comfortable ears (for this reason wear ear-to-ear), sound quality, are well purchased."
"It's a bit painful for little ears like me, but it's not good, and at this price it can't be asked for more."
"Listen, it's okay, it's good music."
I heard it and it was okay... but singing in a karaoke app isn't cool... but it's like five stars.
You should buy an earpiece at this store. It's a very friendly shop.
"The earpiece is super good for the price, it sounds good, it's good for recording, it's plastic on the outside, it's sustainable, it's generally good for the belly."
"I'm hearing ears, I can hear them, I can hear them, I can hear them, I can hear them, I can hear them, I can hear them, I can't hear them, I can't hear them, I can't hear them, I can't hear them, I can't hear them, I can't hear them."
"It sounds good, going to the noisy market and hearing, okay, long-time products are a bit of a pain in the ear, but it's good to remind you to wear less earpieces."
"Let's play a game. Okay, mic's a little small, steals a week's worth of leopard bites."
"With ears on, sound quality fits the price."
"Good sound, no ear pain, good resistance."
It sounds good. It's good to use it. It doesn't hurt to wear it. It doesn't hurt.
There's a lot of pressure on the sound.
"Pack your bags carefully, quickly delivered, good prices, meet your basic needs and the right individuality is to go home to meet Ms. Cappuccino, Zoom on your laptop."
Good quality at a price range.
"Good sound, few ears that don't hurt by design outside your ears. Lightness, convenient use in different places."
"The ear listens good, the game's good, but it's going to hurt a little bit, and it's a great product."
"Sp looks good, sure, and catch an eye."
"The sound's clear, but not so good. Okay, at the price range, small ears like yours will hurt. 8/10ths, okay?"
"It's nice, it's a little earache, but it's not going to worry about a broken wire. It's got an outside membrane, it's easy to use, so it's good to buy it."
"The earpiece's fine at the point of price, so buy it, so there's no detail of it either."
"It sounds good, but it's got a bit of an earache."
"The sound's fine, not as expected, not as delivered on time, not as bad as it sounds for a long time."
I bought a laptop for a pretty meeting.
"The earpiece is made of metal, so it's hard-wired, and the wire and the complete ear is beautiful, and it sounds like it's online okay, the quality is unknown, hopefully fine."
"Good earproof hearing, no ear pain, sounds good."
The headset is fine at the price of Tiki's delivery on time.
"It's okay, it's a little loud to his ears, it's a lot of earaches, it sounds pretty good."
It's Remax RM-Delta.
"Packages of whole boxes, fixed wires, must be used for some time to see the durability of ntn"
"Beautiful product, quality."
"The quality product is good at the price range. The wire, the cover, it's solid."
"Sound sounds good, quality and perfection are good, use these headsets to clear your ears."
It's extremely satisfying. It's not like I'm worried about the rubber that's stuck in my ear.
Good Sp.
It's a very good quality sound for hearing ears.
"At this price, the ear is fine. It doesn't matter. Good job."
"It's cheap, it's kind of okay."
"The negative is fine compared to the price, good design, sure."
Sounds good.
"Sound's fine, no earaches, no noise attacks."
Let's use it.
"Hold your ears, it's fine."
"Good product, better buy it."
"Light, quick, sound good."
"Good at the price, my ears are a little big, so I'm wearing them loose."
Good.
The quality of headset fits the price of money.
The ear sounds pretty good.
"Good headsets, sound good, strong wires and cheap prices."
"Listen to the music. OK, the quality of delivery is not too fast."
It's been two months. It's been good for the price.
The ear is definitely covered in plastic outside of the wire.
It's pretty cool.

"In fact, the product's bad for two days."
"The quality of headset is terrible, it's awkward, it doesn't matter, it doesn't have ears on it, it's better at this price."
"It hasn't been long since it's been broken, I must say the goods are really bad."
"It's good at the price, it's quick delivery, it's designed to catch the eye, but whatever's in there, guys."
Normal sound quality. Sound control button not working?
"Not yet, but SP looks pretty good and sure."
"The hearing is pretty good compared to the cost of money, the noise resistance is on average."
Headset's fine.
"Listen to the music, don't buy it."
"Sound down, audio down button, it's not working, it's not working, it's not working, it's not working, it's not working, it's not working, it's not working, it's not working, it's not working, it's not working."
"The sound's pretty rough, especially in winter with the clothes on the edge of the metal."
"Metal hearing ears, which are heavier than the usual samples, thin wires, which are covered with thin plastic outside."
The quality's a lot worse than the phone ear of tens of thousands.
"The hearing is pretty loose, the wires are loose. The sound quality is average."
"It's worth it, not excellence."
The cave is okay.
Not exactly what I ordered.
"I've just bought them, they're shy, they're hard to listen to."
I don't have a bass ear. I can hear you.
It's not good to hear music with phone calls.
"The purchase was damaged quickly, causing shocks in the ear."
"Sound good, negative material, good at the price."
"It's gonna be okay, but it's only been a month or so, and it's not clear what's causing it."
We can't use it. There's a crack.
It's only been a few days since the earpiece's broken.
"The hearing ear is fine at a price range, but the microphone is poor, and the plastic is easy to lose."
"Hurry up, bad quality."
"It sounds good, but it's twisted."
"Bad hearing ear, a few days broke."
Sounds good from the desktop.
"headsets are good, but every time you plug in, there's a sound key."
"It's a little loud in the ears, it's a lot of pain, it's a headache, it's not a scratch."
"I'm listening to you. I'm sorry, I'm sorry."
Headset's fine.
"The sound's bad, bass can't be clear, it's a deaf fight."
Take a short time to break
"It's a pretty good ear, fast delivery and proper sample."
The earpiece's fine compared to the price.
I heard it right on one side.
"Send it back to the disfigured box, which is fine with the sound."
Sound ok
I'm fine.
Headset's good.
Headset's fine.

() Uncalculated ear work is packed with two other items (spoiled in a large box) with a package wrapped around a corner.
"Well-wrapped, but the moths have a great feel and capital."
"The right headset is sitting in the cold machine room, it's against the top noise, it's too much music, it's a book, there's one thing that's controlling the app on the top, it's bad, it's bad, it's bad, it's bad, it's bad, it's bad."

"The cellfones received a deposit, but they didn't notice the delivery day, and they just put it on Tiki the next day, and they're full of them, and I'm happy with Tiki."

"Fast delivery, which sounds much brighter than XM3/4, which is still the tip of the top."

"Tiki makes quick delivery, secures the company and warranty."
Beautiful.
It's a product that's satisfying.
"Good hunting, quality off the best table."

Good.
That's great.
Good phone.
"There's a lot of diversity with lots of izers, and a lot of young music, and EDD sounds like love music doesn't apply very well. If you like bass too much, you can pick this XM5."
Great.
"Listen to music very well, but you can't get access to phones, including Android or iOS, while the connection on your laptop is very good. I hope tiki explains it to you."
OK.
"It's been a long time since Tiki's bought so much change, the delivery's pretty fast and everything's going to be moving from the package to the delivery, and Tiki Trading's sales is always standard, it's going to be pretty fast, it's going to be back to Tiki and it's going to buy again."

There's no English manual. There's nothing a customer knows how to use.
"Beautiful goods, Saigon for the first time isn't what it looks like. It's only about 10 meters in the air, and it's five meters if there's a door."
"Nice tag, pretty bell, or forget your keys, everybody."
Buying out your backpack for school because you borrowed the iPhone nearby to update your location so that it's slow enough to locate you.
"He's trying to buy a car in a parking lot, but it doesn't make sense."
It's only 100 meters in the house. You can't go far.
The goods are scratchy.
It won't take long. It won't work.

"Good, quick delivery."
"The operation is good, however the location is inaccurate, sometimes the signal's out."
It costs more than something else to set up than a return.
It's cheap.
The good stuff is all over the place. Okay.

"Locking up, fast delivery. App supports multiple functions, fine ACC noise removal mode, which is short for talking and moving between hearing modes when staying, walking, or running. Sound well, bass is fine, midb is fine. to hear Spotify is fine. to listen to Spotify every day is ok"
"The hearing ear is exactly the same as the original firm! Installed and hear the functions show the product is too good. how the sound, translucent mode, smart mode, as well as the sound sounds are working and the feedback is good."
I think ACC is better than airpod pro.
Very pleased.

"The main company is seal, but tiki is faster than expected."
The teacher doesn't mean she can't hear anything.
The tiki package delivered very quickly yesterday has a good product quality at a very worthwhile price.
"Tiki puts the delivery within an hour (taken at Q1) since the order was ordered, the whole package-set box has been suspended for printing stamps, and the tuổi quality of the 720p camera can't require goods, but at less than 500K, there's nothing to blame for."

"It's nice. The shop should pack up more shock packs, thanks."
"It's good to use it. Five stars for the shop. I've only been able to use it for two days. I don't know, but it's on Tiki Trading, so it's reassuring."
"Okay, good product."
It's worth the money. <i>Put it on the PC.</i> <i>The beautiful orange look.</i>

"The company itself is simply light, automated auto-installed when pining on PC. the quality of the video is good, the microbuld-in is loud and clear."
"Package received, image sharp."
"It's nice, it's well packed, it hasn't been used, it doesn't appreciate the quality, it's more than expected."

It takes more time to evaluate.

"Webcam is easy to use, just with USB port connections to be used, which is equal to a laptop web cam."
"The cheap web cams are appropriate for the video ~ The quick delivery is without error, so choose to save the fire without Webcam"
"Use it well, the company itself, will continue to support Tiki..."
The G.C.'s good with the knives.
"It's the company, it's good."
"It's a standard product, like described, good product in terms of money."
Very pleased.
"Good quality orange, balanced image"
It's genuine.
"The quality of the image is good, unfortunately no focus."
Okay.
"Fine within the price range. The image describes for auto-sharp features, but I try to scan the text nearby and it doesn't automatically use text to see text. The index for using text at close focus cannot be used."
"Hurry up and call for two hours, rock for the cave, home for the family."
"Good image, handy, easy-to-do, close year-out."
"The product is valuable and the quality is very reasonable, and the Volvotech brand is very stable and stable."
"Every point that doesn't like is a little bit of a close angle, doesn't cover the landscape."
"The Webcam is easy to use, plugs the head of web into a self-imposed machine. Image quality is fine for online learning; the price of buying is cheaper than the other place to sell it, fast delivery, but probably because of low-value electronics, Tiki packaged long, box-to-tale delivery, Webcam box, which the Tiki box is large, inserting a little extra plastic wrap should be loose."
"The delivery is scheduled, packed carefully, like the description, because the quality is 720 so it's not too sharp, but it's okay."
It's good for Tiki to sell the product.
"The image quality, the sound's OK, the design grips on the edge of the screen and the orange angle is nothing special, so it's just a loose shot on the screen and it doesn't rotate in horizontal, just looks up and down."
"The product ok, however, the box during the transport has been badly broken even though there's a piece of the sticker that's been broken."
"It's good, it's good. Zoom's got a bad image. It's a bad price, it's a good one, it's a good one, it's a good one, it's a bad one, it's a bad one, it's a good one, it's a good one, it's a good one, it's a bad one, it's a good one."
"The image's normal, the design's pretty bad, the loose pin doesn't hold the camera, the camera goes down on the table all the time."
"Other model delivery products, but they still seem to be standard, bad delivery time... from HCM to HN that eight days before we get them while spling the baby."
"The quality of the camera I haven't been able to check, but for the time of delivery, it's important for you guys to get out of here from the beginning of the week to the weekend, because I think the delivery is fast, when others need sp, it's more important than you guys."
Maybe I'm used to better cameras?
"The product is in tiki, but it's been a couple of months, so how does the warranty work?"
I've spent two weeks of my time with Mic. It's really annoying. I can't use it. Cameras don't usually do. This money doesn't require it.
"The company's main goods, full box, rapid delivery, normal P.C. quality, medium prices, don't require high quality."
"The light quality's a little bad, the sharpness and color is acceptable."
"It's not a good recording microphone, it's a little bit more timid than the laptop's built-in mic. It's a lot of noise, and it's not as loud as advertising."
"When I bought it, it was okay. <i>It wasn't for two weeks.</i> <i>It was broken.</i> <i> Thanks to Tiki's support for other goods.</i> <i>I don't know.</i> <i>I'm sorry.</i> <i>I'm sorry.</i> <i>I'm sorry.</i> <i>I'm sorry.</i> <i>I'm sorry.</i>"
"No sharpness, no picture is as cheap as a cheap one, and durability has to take some time to evaluate it."
"The delivery is on schedule, the amount of photos and sounds is OK compared to the amount of money."
"take the package carefully and new, just messing with the image and not getting rid of the sound, the log line right now looks like it's got logi because it's on search's web to know."
I'm worried.
Okay.
"Webcam for good images, without testing the microphones, long-time wires, long-term shifts, over a week's worth."
"Quick delivery, pick up boxes and see that the box and oranges aren't like apps, it's not clear how accurate it is, it's right, it's used to figure out what the quality is."

"The oranges aren't that great, but the price's too good."
"It's too slow to deal with, and it's getting worse and worse."
"The image is unclear, making it unclear to the person who sees it."
"Webcam is easy to use, colors and beautiful styles. Sets it to the screen. Image quality is pretty good within the price range."
"Package just received. Nice package, sure. No audio test."
"The label on sp is Logarithm, not Logotech as shown in the picture."
The quality is fine. The downside is impossible to put on a thin border screen.
Translucency cameras must be removed and re-focused.
Quality time: average.
"The product is solid, neat, sharp, sound-sounded; I'm just plugging in Linux, without any installation or software."
Fine. No mistakes in history.
"It's a clear image, but it's sprained across."
The delivery is faster than expected.

The webcam just bought a week ago. It's been broken. The camera from the laptop is gone.
"The quality's fine, but at a price like that, it's okay."
Okay.
Is Sp ok still waiting to be used?
Can we film it until we talk about something that's noisy and awkward to talk about throughout the course of the sound receiving?
"Thank you, tiki. Thank you very much."
The delivery is in order. Be careful. Be clear.
Okay.
The quality's fine. It's very satisfying.
"Why does my G.I.V. have logi's on it without a ""tech""?"

"Well, it's quite a hug, even though it's a 13-inch line up, it's a little bit of an impromptu, and the push is not very sensitive, and the front part is a little bit higher than the screen, and the plus one is pretty thin, and the cutting detail can also be called sharp."

"Thanks to the Tiki and the shop, I'll keep buying it, not like a lot of pages, but I'll be sick of hanging a pig's head."

"- Good charge. - Sometimes there's a second portal error. Any port, no power."
"It's quick, but it's not good enough. It's worth the money."
"I'm not satisfied, I'm talking fast and I can't even charge half a day, it's all bad publicity for two."
"I think the delivery was pretty quick, and the actual delivery time was like the expected time on Tiki's newspaper, and the white clip was a little bit of colory, but, on the other hand, elegant."
"There's no way we can charge it if we don't charge it, we can't charge it 50 percent by the time we don't charge it."
"After almost five months of use, the charge was damaged, and now it's six, 2024, almost a year, and the whole charge is broken."
"Tiki delivers fast, phone calls before delivery. The product is fine, quickly charged & compatible with such devices as iphone, ipad,...has two connections."

Satisfaction
"I don't remember how much I bought from Anker, but when there was a need to buy these side effects, I always chose Anker. This battery of Anker continues to please me."
"Anker's brand follows him as the best third party brand, which I'm most likely to introduce to my friends because they're small and charge them a lot of times to the iPhone X."
"I've been buying this backup for about three days and I've been clean for a couple of days and I've been getting really good, I've got no battery and I've got a quick charge, I've got S9 pluss, I've got about one and a half."
"It's worth a lot of money, short charge, short charge, low charge, low power, 8 hours worth of money, and it's worth a lot of money."
"The small battery, charging seven plus quick, Tiki had a two-hour delivery service, ordered it less than an hour later than she got, and it's just a one-door output, so it's only going to charge one machine at a time."
"It's very small, it's very high-intensive, and it's got a bag of cloth in it that's very convenient for people to buy."
"Tiki makes the delivery very quickly, the night before noon already exists, but the charge doesn't come in after a few days until the battery goes off when the charge goes off, the contact with tiki is changed very quickly for three days and then there is one."
Let's hit it fast.
"It's perfect, it's perfect, it's really tight, it's fast and it's not hot."
"This is the fourth child I've bought for my friends who have needs, and I've spent more than three years on my own."
"The cost of right, small, light, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low."
"I use the same Anker plug gate to charge this battery very quickly, the battery uses about four and a half charges to the iphone 6splus, and it's pretty much as fast to charge it."
"It's neat and it's beautiful, it's super fast, it's buyin' two pieces."
"Good quality, fancy design, proportional to the price of money, very pleased with Tiki's delivery services."
"The backup battery is so small that it's going to be needed, there's four flights of flashlights, it's easy to use, it's easy to plug in without any more buttons, plus Anker's brand, so it's more trusting than any other Chinese."
"The micro charge charge is easy to carry, the 10K battery is quite buffaloy, the charge processor and the automatic charge switch is quite agreeable, and the only difference is that it's pretty tight, and the first few times it's hard, but it doesn't really matter."
"Using this girl for half a year and then reviewing it, and it's off the table, and I'm still using thephone five, which is about four times the white one should be able to pick the white one that's easy to see, and it's still good, and I don't like the bag that's attached to it."
"I find that the products that are very good at charging are neither hot nor hot nor charged, but they're a little slow, but they're generally okay, beautiful and easy to carry."
Please! <i>The charge is not heated when you charge it as well as when you charge your cell phone.</i> <i>For your ip6 you can charge 4l if you don't charge it while you use it.</i> <i>The charge is much faster than any of the other devices.</i> <i>It's a lot faster than any of the other devices.</i> <i>Five for Tiki!</i>
"I've got the product, it's still been a long time, more than a year, the tiki delivery a day earlier than expected, the product that's on sale should be cheaper than the outside, hoping that tiki will continue to have the same recommended programs."
"Super love charge Anker... no heat, no quick charge, no handle... so black, it's clean... and it's very recommended to anyone who wants to buy a backup charge... but if it's against E, it's not very thin... but if it's okay with anyone else, it's okay."
"Small, handy, good quality, good quality, that's what I get from an Anker's backup battery, and I love Anker's products for bringing in trust and security."
"The charge was steady, the charge was off when I charge it myself, but it didn't go off when I charge it myself, I think it's the only subtraction point of charge."
"Pins use ok, tiki is well packed, the quality is long before you know it."
"I bought this backup charge for a long time and used it very long, especially though 10,000 metersAh, design is much smaller than any other battery, easy to fit in a pocket or a small bag to carry in a suitcase."
"I bought this battery on the storm, 30 percent promotion for an arker, and after three days, the package arrived, and I didn't see any news of the delivery coming, which was a little surprise. (TRN) The battery went to HN, which was light, which was cool, and the battery was cooler than the battery. A little while ago, I used the battery to thepad, and I didn't get a quick charge, so I didn't have to try it. The battery for my son C4, I couldn't give it to thepad, but I'm sure it was better than once and a half."
"It's a nice package, it's a beautiful piece, the product's been ripped off to put on the seal, but it doesn't matter, thank you very much."
"Tiki delivers as fast as it's near New Year's, and the charge is fine, the phone is fast and it's not hot."
"28/2018: I just got it, I just got it off a couple of times, line out 2.4 A, using it very well, shut it down when it's fully charged the battery and give it to my iphonepad, so I'm going to use line 2A to charge the battery quickly."
"I bought it right for Tikinker, down-priced for 27 percent of Tiki's delivery in two days, back to the Hex of Jing."
"You're sure to look beautiful, with a bag and a tie, and you charge a four-line S.S.9 battery, and you're cool with it."
"Get the package fully charged+Kyr (With Anker box), carefully packed. Output: Charge k with heat. Input: charge until the power is full of power shut down."
"The charge to the battery is stable, the 5S charge is only a few days away from the charge (two times a day)."
"Never let down by the tiki, the good package, the real goods, the quick delivery."
"It's great for quality and form and packaged, small and round-handed, and I charge the S7/20mAh S7DMAh, which three times charge three times, the last time it's close, very nice and dark."
Tot
"A small, light, easy-held, and special charge is fast, and I can charge it about three times on an average if you have to constantly move around and use your cell phone."
"Tiki's packaged well, the battery's fast, not hot, the charge's automatically off, it's small, it's very small, it's a bit of a bit of a last-minute delivery, but it's still on schedule."
"Thank you, salesman and Tiki."
"It's pretty fresh, it's white, it's kind of dirty, it's a charging gate."
"It's a quick hit, it's worth the money."
"The Anker PowerPore, 10,000mAh-A1263 Main Line battery."
"The product is solid, nice package, genuine goods, next time it'll back us up."
"Good product, Cute!"
The quality of the two years is fine.
"It's a nice white box of design, which is about two times as well."
"Anker's goods are off the table, good design, neat design and quality."
"It's called Anker's crabs, raisins and wines."
"I've been introduced to anker's backup charge from a lot of people, and I'm very relieved about the quality of Tiki's good delivery."
"The line is exactly the lower-looking description in the picture. The anker's good for it, bought it, so there's no picture up."
"It's packed with a bag of cloth and a USB thread for the spare battery, it's too good for the price."
Always trust Anker for strength and quality.
The charge charge is nearly three times as high as a battery.
"The package is exactly the same as the product description, it's wrapped up, it's also two or three times charged."
Great quality. I bought it for a year. Today's shopping in tiki should write a comment.
"Fast delivery, packaged, 0-6 s plus you charge three times if there's a situation where you should buy a bigger tolerance."
"The charge charge is good, the quick charge is over 80 percent more efficient."
"I've been using this charge for over three months, charging the iPhone six almost four times."
"It's good, it's sustainable, it's quick for phones, tablet, it's more than three months without problems."
I'm on it and I'm good.
"Quick charge, four charge use, no battery drop."
"Tiki's packed up carefully, with a seal on it, for a year without a problem."
"Anker charge number one, quick charge, good battery holding, expensive, generally should buy"
"The small product, quick charge, and side effects with a bag that will protect the product in the process of its use."
"Tiki delivers fast, packaged carefully"
The product's pretty good. The time is fast and the batteries aren't hot. I don't like white.
"Good quality product, neat size easily carried, nice, modern box."
"For me this product is quite suitable, used for iphone 7 charge four times and lightly carried away if your bag is small."
"The batteries are good, convenient, but the plastic shell is hard to grasp."
"The good product, the packaged form of quality tiki, nothing to blame for."
"Well, the product works as expected, the delivery is on schedule."
"The product is good use, the first neat design is to take it with you."
"It's very satisfying. It's fast, it's not hot. It's going to introduce friends to buy products."
"Good quality, quick charge, small, light design."
I've used a lot of sp Anker.
"Fast and unhealed, very pleased about the product."
"Thank you, Tiki."
"This charge is from Tiki, fast delivery, careful."
"Fast, stable, unheatable and small chargeable"
"Quality guarantee, Tiki's quick support, competition prices, will continue to support Tiki"
"Newly purchased, well used, no problem, likes to use Anker."
"Good quality, quick charge, and multiple charge."
"The battery's so small, so personal, it's comfortable with the anker."
"Excellent quality, stable use, beautiful form, firm grip!"
"Sp is right for advertising, it's smaller than I thought, Anker's safe, it's quick and it's cool."
"Beautiful goods, qualitys, rapid delivery, convenient payment."
"The charge isn't hot, it's very reliable to use an aker, but it's expensive, but it's high and safe."
"Thanks tiki, we got it at a discount."
"It's not hot, it's different than the other, it's automatically cut when the battery's full."
Sp is very neat. 3 hits for S6. Tiki closes and delivers very quickly and carefully.
"Good lord as a result, quite fond of this product."
"The battery is light, the black one I like very much, the tiki package is nice and sure."
"It's good use. Fast, clean, bringing it in."
"The first time I used my backup charge, I'd love to."
"Good good stuff. Tiki's got a nice package, deliver it, and pick it up fast."
"Rows like descriptions, hot, neat,..."
"It's very small, it's tenacious, it's not very strong."
"Nice package and sure, very fast delivery."
Tiki's delivery is exactly as advertised! <i>I charge four times iphone sixs and I still don't run out of batteries.</i> <i>It's a lot smaller than I thought...</i> <i>So it's a good idea that Anker gave me a pretty convenient bag.</i>
"Well, that's right."
"I'm not happy about Tiki's App first because I chose to get rid of the basket that Anker 10.400mAh was black, and all the goods were gone instead of apps jumping through white, the app jumped over me."
It's the old product that's been cut open.
"Small size, slight size, steady hand, automatic disconnect when fully charged, can be used four times on the phone."
"When the charge isn't hot, it's small and easy to carry. The plug is off itself. It's pretty good. The warranty is good. The price's low, so it's pretty cheap. I'm using the new TF-XMBGT account that's down 25%, and that's pretty good for the price as well as the quality."
"We can't charge fast, we can't charge wirelessly, we can't use a plug-in port, we can't charge it fast, we can't charge it wirelessly."
"It should be easy to carry easily, convenient in your pocket. The sufficient amount for personal needs (3 times 6s pluss or 4 times), free from heating."
"I've lost my technology, and I've been allowed to buy this, so far so good, the first few times I've been charging the battery into a bit of a long time, but the next time the regular charge is like using a battery (or the equivalent) -- white is pretty -- medium size, put it in a woman's pocket."
"We've been using backup charge to charge the phone, we've been using xyomi 10,000 lower charges, but we haven't had a battery, and since we've been using an aker, we've had a terrible quick charge, and the battery has been extremely fast."
"I bought and I used my product for two months, and I felt that the charge was very good, but I didn't know that the product had been attached to the USB cable because I used the phone charge to charge the battery, and when I got the box that was no longer sealed, there were batteries and bags inside, and I still kept the box, and I checked that there wasn't a single plus cable, which was part of the fault of the time that I received the customer's unchecked, but I wanted to make sure that Tiki's more interested than the managers at the stock, because this kind of thing didn't please the customers."
Search@action: button
"I got the product very quickly, and I love Tiki at this point, and I thought it was a fake because the envelope was different from the previous one, and when they emailed Anker, they said they changed their envelopes."
"Quick delivery, but the quality of the product is not in use."
"I charge the iphone seven plus, but the charge's pretty fast, so I'm a little afraid to affect the machine, which I charge a couple of times my iphone 7 plus my sensors are charged, and I don't dare to use them."
Okay.
"The delivery product's been stamped, phoned for a change, and then changed to another product, which is the same as the previous one, needing an explanation."
"- Advantage: + Be careful, nice and neat package. + confirm that Anker's code is the main item."
"I signed up last Thursday, so it's still in the sp period, but I'm quite pleased with Taki's package, delivery, and customer care."
"The 12-hour charge is still in one line, please change the product for help"
"The first one is to find the code to check what's the second row, which is that without the third stamp, is a long-term charge problem (more than 10 hours later), which sums up the correct answer:"
"It's not right to be satisfied because check code is auth, but the box shell is being peeled at the bottom, kind of confused, and I'm buying the battery, and the wire is going down, so any of you are going to get the same as me."
"I've got a two-phone battery charge, and I've got a midband2 test, and I've got to get into the power, and I've got to get the lights off, and I've got to get the phone charge, and I can't charge smartphone."
"It's beautiful, it's neat, it's not like a train line, it's a battery that's fast and it's automatically shut down when the batteries are full, it's very good right now, and how much longer can Saigon be known?"
"The delivery is offered, but o is offered in exchange."
"It's worth a little bit of money, but it doesn't matter if you want your smartphone to last long enough."
"First, we got a 30% discount, we're down to 595K, now we're up to 750k. Pins are good, two-and-a-half times charge to 5/4."
"It took 8 to 10 hours to fill up the backup charge, not knowing if it would improve in the next few times, buying for brands."
The delivery is too slow. It's not like the commitment to use TikiNow.
"Hi, I asked you to change the backup charge product I received yesterday because I've been charging all night and I still haven't gotten two lines."
The battery was not very hot. The machine was extremely disappointed.
"The product was delivered by Tiki for 24 hours, packed carefully, small, clean size, slightly heavy hand, and the advantage is to charge fast, automatically shut down when the device is full of batteries, five times the iPhone charge is not dead yet."
"The beautiful, neat product, I used to charge S8 casserole, except there's no adapine charge with a backup charge."
"The new product, beautiful, fastship, but without a warranty, the tiki warranty for January 15th is how do you confirm it?"
"One, the product is delivered with a nice, new, acceptable package."
"I ordered a spare battery, but when I got it, the box was gone. >"
Automatically disable source when fully charged but not automatically disable when fully charged to another device.
"Fast delivery (one hour since laid) Small, neat, firm handle handles have been perfect, quick charged, cool box cartons old and open first"
We're also using some of this brand's products. I love this product! It's a famous American brand. >
"There's something else in Anker's, it's got a firm grip, it's a nice, fancy charge, it's basically nothing to complain about."
"About two days' use, a third light is down, a product that's not as sustainable as advertised, it doesn't know how to maintain it."
"What's wrong with the TIKIANKER discount code, tiki?"
"When the lights are charged, you don't blink like the 5200."
"Tiki delivers it faster than usual, packs it carefully, it looks nice and sure."
"The product's good, but the delivery time's a little slow."
"Fast delivery, full cover, with extra bags, five-second charge."
"There's nothing so special about it, it's unstable, it's hot when it's not."
"Tiki makes a quick delivery, just bought it, so it's going to take some time to see what the quality is."
"It's easy to use, it's not good. Try to write enough 50 characters."
It's a good level of satisfaction. 2600mAh battery and three full charges.
"The product's okay, the delivery's quick, the service attitude's okay."
"It's a nice, careful package, pretty good product."
"The battery's right, it's sustainable, but it's been in for a long time. (6 or 6 hours)"
"It's pretty good, small, plastic shell, not metal."
"I've been buying this backup charge for two days, using it very well, beautiful design, small, light, cool, fully charged battery-free, but I don't know if I need to run out of batteries and charge eight hours in the first three use, who knows who I'm with."

Nice company main product.
The quick delivery shop is so beautiful that it supports the shop next time.

The product's not damaged.
Nice stuff!
"It's a little leg. It's like, you know, if you click on it, it'll shake both the machine and the base."
The product is good within the price range.

"The dealer says the cable can charge the Xiaomi phone, but my Xiaomi's phone doesn't charge anything."
"delivers only 32 to 50 mb as slow as 10 times as the fox's advert. We don't know how to charge it, so we don't know what's going on."
"The wire seems solid, but the charge isn't very good. The packaged restaurant is just a piece of paper in general."
"Bad delivery, paydays and more than a week. When you meet a counselor, you're on edge with tiki services, customers should reconsider."
What kind of business store is this?
The charge isn't for me to change.
Acceptable at such a price.
The package's fine without a manufacturer. It's not a good sign.
Good.
It's good.
The wrong purchase should be used tam
Good.
Okay.
I don't know what's going on here.

"It's not metal in plastic, it's very good metal codes last time."
"After nine long days of waiting, calling the operator's name over and over again, Anker's wife came to her hand, feeling at first: the strong black shell, holding hands firmly, the holding shell really likes the battery for 7 Plus fast."
"Thank you, tiki. I'm very pleased with this product. Six seconds charge."
"The backup charge is quite OK, it's quick, it's classy, it's definitely good to use it for a while!"
"It's very appropriate for a regular person to be on the move, but the thing is, I'm kind of wondering, when the battery is full of batteries and then pulls it out on a table that doesn't connect or touch anything, sometimes the lights are lit up a couple of times, and when the battery is three lines away, there's no such thing as this:"
"Anker's discount rate should cost you more than two million dollars, but now it's extremely satisfying to hear your friend compliments on it, and now it's been an Anker fan."
"It's well packed, careful, it's convenient, it's fast, it's stable, it's very stable, it's a bag full of Styrofoams."
"The product is exactly the same as the picture, packaged carefully, delivered quickly, with an anker's warranty stamp, used for a long time, but it's still going well, it's going to take more than a day to fill this battery."
"Tiki delivers fast, full accessories, quality."
Quick delivery.
"It's nice, it's cool, but there's no ip, it's got to be personal, but it's still 5 seconds."
"Top of the tiki service, tikinow, quick delivery, safe and steady quality."
"Fast delivery, carefully packed, enthusiastic, cheerful employees, foreign products such as advertising."
Good.
"It's only been two weeks, cost and appearance, compared to capacity, carrying a dress that's not too heavy, it's not too hot to charge, it's hopefully still stable after a while."
"The first purchase was in tiki, the delivery was fast, and the packaged goods were very careful, and there was a very high-performable, but it was very light, and yet there were no charges, and there was no high-performing USB type-C charge to charge the laptop, so it was only appropriate for the users to charge other mobile devices that didn't need to charge more than 18 kilowatts."
"It's been two days and I'm very self-sustaining in Tiki with a product that I bought with a quality Anker brand off of the eagle, and I hope that Tiki will return the product to my customers."
Very good.
"It's been very buyin' for a long time, and it's been very OK to charge your phone while it's not hot. <i>It's good to use two mobile phones.</i> <i>and blackberry 9900.</i> <i>This charge will last a week at a normal rate of use, it's okay.</i> <i>The main store should be fairly secure.</i> <i>The only difference is that there's no quick charge, and it's almost 1.5 days of battery charge.</i>"
"It's a little heavy, but it's good, nice pattern, healthy batteries."
"It's small, it's quality."
"Standard goods, good quality, safe use."
It's okay.
"Tiki delivers it very quickly in half a day, and Anker's product is tested, charging it faster than any other brand's backup charge line, and by the time you get a discount code and a lightning cable from Tiki, thank you."
"I'm very pleased with tiki's delivery services, but I don't know the quality of the product I just bought."
"I've bought it for a long time, and Tiki delivers super fast, and he's got a cable charge for the iphone, and I've charged a six-plus orchid, and two micropads, four from ~10%pin, and the battery is full of three lines."
The product was delivered a little bit slowly.
It's good. It's good. It's good.
"I used Anker because my colleagues used it, everyone came back from Japan, and the last day I saw Tiki's discount, so I bought it, because the product was distributed by Tiki, and I got it."
"Small, fast convenient"
Good quality.
Sp ok
Nice stuff. Okay.

Normal
"Very fast delivery 40 minutes after placing, nice sp, quality."
"High quality goods, timely delivery, professional."
"Tiki's on the move fast, packaged, quick-loaded, secure, four charges periphone 6S, but the signal light is still on three."
Good Use
It's a good product. It's a good product.
It's good to buy the right tiki discount.
normal row
Minbh mat a battery now buys a little something right away from a robot battery that doesn't believe in the state of anker.
Good.
Good stuff.
"The delivery is on schedule, but I've already written a 30-minute notice, but you deliver it to the front door when you're at home at the right time."
"Getting the product from Tiki feels relatively secure, from packing, delivered goods, and it's only because you don't care about the size that should be so big that you look at the picture that's thin and you think it's small."
It's pretty good.
"Pack your bags carefully, buffalo batteries, not xiao-like fantasies."
Buy it again.
"But it's been a long time, more than a week since the delivery was delivered."
My Note 9 can charge about five times.
"The Anker PowerPore battery is 20100 meters, high capacity for 7 days is not dead yet."
"Nice Sp, trade is much faster than expected. Tomorrow night, we'll get a 20 percent discount."
"It's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, but it's small size, it's small size."
"A full battery charge could charge an ip 8 plus 2 times plus a minipad, a little bit of charge, but it's okay with a lot of volume."
"I've never been with you before. I've never been with you, but I've never been with you before."
"Input the top microphone is too uncomfortable, the output is that web doesn't have one head for type C, doesn't have fast charge support, it's generally too uncomfortable to buy two different wires."
"The box is intact, the main product, nice, quick charge, but not hot."
"Even if it's a backup charge, it's quick to charge, best to use it with an aker charge."
Very good. The product's very popular. The battery's on the cell phone.
"Use good, quick charge but on the box do not see q-code check of anker"
"It's good, it's fast, it's not hot, it's good price, it's worth it."
"Don't worry, it's two longs."
"This product is good, it doesn't see any errors, but the price is still a little high."
"- It's in a box with glue on it, but there's a scratch on it, like, three centimeters."
The backup charge failed to charge for the iTunes and could not be charged from the input.
"The charge doesn't go into the power, charges the battery for four hours without a trace, I don't know why we're trying to find out."
"I bought the product from November 2017, and by the month of 1840018, the battery had a bad sign, and the signal light was not working, and I sent it back unplugged."
"The first time I'm gonna charge enough batteries, I'm gonna put a few pounds into it, and I'm gonna hit the power. What's wrong with that? Where's BH?"
"Buy it, use it or lose it, press the two-and-a-half-minute charge button."
"Let me ask you why it's so long since I've been charged, I can't even charge myself."
"The product was good, each one before the delivery should have called about 10 minutes before the receiver was ready, because it would have taken more than five minutes to get it, and when you guys were afraid to deliver it, you'd have to press one or two times as hard as it would make the buyer feel like you were sleeping and call yourself down to get it, it would take you seven minutes to get it."
"Code 20 percent and 760K at November 11th, everything's fine, but this time tiki's not doing well, so she's gonna buy a ticket, and she's gonna need a warrant, and she's gonna need some time to figure it out."
"Do I text the feedback message that hasn't been answered by the store? Why do I charge this product for 10 hours and only one step away from knowing how many hours this product first charge is full of batteries, shop?"
"Saigon can't, WTF, it's hard to figure out how much time we don't have, and now we're gonna turn the batteries on four, and then we're gonna drop everything, and then we're gonna lose everything, and then we're gonna lose 100 percent of the product, and we're gonna pay us back."
I'm fine.
"The battery's good, the phone's full of batteries."
"Anker's battery isn't a table, this model is high, but there's no quick charge in Input, so it's going to take a long time to charge it."
"It's normal, no quick charge."
"I bought this backup charge, I used it twice as well, and the third time I didn't red the fourth light, using a 50 percent phone on the phone is off the grid."
"I used the iPhone's Adamet to charge the battery, but it took about >10 hours to fill the battery."
"The first time we bought SP on tiki, the product went wrong, it was so frustrating, asking for tiki to return the product, just to see if tiki's services are reliable to continue shopping next time?"
I can't believe this one didn't support QC.
Okay.
The size is a little big. <i>I don't know if the sp failed or sp designed like that.</i> <i>I haven't had time to call.</i> <i>The charge to another device is fast.</i>
"Eight hours, 80 percent of your phones are required to return the product."
The charge should not be slippery as Anker 26800 bought it.
"A 20100mAh backup battery is very good, has been charged many times for nokia six, has a bag and cable, it's basically a perfect product."
"There's a lot to charge, a strong hand, a bag full of recharges for a long time, about 10-12 hours."
"The product's pretty good, but there's no quick chap!"
"Careful delivery, packaged, layers, firms, four stars long: (but still for tiki's continued)"
"The 20,000 battery we charge is about three times, like 12,000."
"The product's pretty ok, charge the iphone seven pluss about four-and-a-half times, travel with it, don't worry about it."
It's a 20100mAh A1271 shipment of good quality.
"It's quick, it's very small, so let's try it."
"I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it."
"The unplugged mouse you buy is very light, you can pick it up, it's clean, it's white and it's pretty nice. Click it nice, it's sensitive, and there's another mouse that's got to buy batteries."
"The product has the right quality of the description, the package is solid, it's valuable, it's quick delivery."
"Fast delivery, nice mouse, sensitive, good money, 3 hours worth of charge, never ran out of batteries, not even a 10-star shop."
"The mouse has Type-Clot charge on everyone. When you don't use it for five minutes, you can use it on your own. You can use it for two hours. You can use it for a week. You can't use it any longer. The mouse has a shortcut on the bottom, but when you don't use it for five minutes, you can use it on your own, you can save your battery."
"First, you'll see a nice package, you'll have two hours of delivery. Rats are exactly the same pattern, click with no audio, smooth, steady hands."
"It's only been an hour since she's got it, she's got it, she's got it, she's got it, she's got it, she's got it, she's got it, she's got it, she's got it, she's got it, she's got it, she's got it, she's got it, she's got it, she's got it, she's got it, she's got it, she's got it, she's got it, she's got it, she's got it, she's got it, she's got it, she's got it, she's got it's got it."
"And I like that button, and it doesn't make the sound as much as it used to be, and after a check and review, I decided to buy it, and I also decided to send a psychological evaluation."
"Nice style, fashion fits the price. <i>Small press.</i> <i>It's very convenient to move.</i> <i>The package and delivery are on schedule.</i> <i>Thank you, tiki.</i> <i>Thank you very much.</i> <i>Thank you.</i> <i>Thank you.</i> <i>Thank you very much.</i>"
"Fast delivery, well done."
"This mouse is so high, we're all over the house, we've got no noise, we've got a smooth mouse, we've got a good hand, we've got a good hand, we've got a good price, we've got real quick delivery, we've booked last night, we've got five stars for this afternoon, it's worth it, it's worth it, it's worth it."
"The initial feeling is good, the design is good, and there is no click when you click it. With the back key to home stable, you can use more. Fast delivery. The only change is the top signal if the design with the same color and mouse will be better when you attach it to your laptop."
"The mouse is so nice and light, no need for a mouse pad to move so OK. The sound of clicking is still listening, but at an acceptable level, it's not too big. It's giving us two boxes outside and we don't take those two boxes."
"The mouse clicks are very smooth, the noise is very small, it's soft, it's soft, it's smooth, it's nice, it's nice, it's brand-new, and especially what you like when you're going to buy is that the mouse doesn't charge the battery, because it's not that wrong, it's not that bad, it's that fast, the delivery is coming."
"The mouse is smooth, the pull-up button is not very smooth, so that 2 meters is still able to surf the mouse, and it's not confused with other wireless mice."
"The third time, rats are cheap, but they're good for mac, and they're cheap, so they're mechanical, so it's convenient, first, to use bad plastics."
"Beautiful design, from color to shape, I prefer it to use electricity instead of batteries."
"The pink mouse is so beautiful, it's so small, it's so firm, it's smooth, it's how long it takes to use it."
"Saigon rats are smooth, fast delivery, beautiful mice."
The package is nice and careful.
"Mouse looks too high, they're always, they're the right pink, they look too much, they're good, they're cheap, they're strange because there's more buttons than other normal mice, there's also a shortcut button for the deskop screen and they adjust the sensitivity of the mouse."
"Mouse is so nice, it's appropriate for people to like the lightness, to turn it off automatically when they don't waste the batteries, to be a little too sensitive to touch light hands and click as well."
"Rats are high quality, so buy them, use them hand-to-hand, wait for them to find out, support the shop..."
"Perfect for his laptop, exactly as advertised, well packed, supportive, 5-star vote."
"Rats were very smooth, and everyone in the city kept commending them, and I advertised that “only 134K on Tikidundu"
"The mouse is very sensitive, thin and small, no sound, right description. The black light looks very elegant. Very nice."
"The mouse uses it quite well, the press is smooth. Takes a smaller feeling than you think, but it's fine."
"Because of the translation, the order's been delivered for a long time, but it's okay, it's in the box, it's pretty careful, it's nice, it looks good, it's good for the office worker, it's a good price."
"Rats are cheap, but they're very smooth, they're not going to listen to noise, they're going to come back, they're not going to pay for batteries, they're going to support the shop."
"The first time you've had a rat with a wire, a nice sample, and you've used it well, it's sensitive."
The cute little mouse is so bad... it's a little sticky... ahihi... I love it... I'm with thepad with the beautiful mouse... it's a laptop mouse.
I love this tough black color.
It's like the picture. It's not until it's done that makes sense of the quality and durability.
"The good, the light, the high sensitivity, the good looks, buys the satles, gets a good price, introduces friends to buy."
"If you use it, you will find it sensitive. The unknownness should temporarily evaluate 5* because of the & fast delivery mouse"
"Sensitive Mouse, Design and Beautiful Materials"
"They're quarantined, so they invest in a new mouse. They don't know their hands at first, so they're a little weird."
"The mouse moves are smooth, there's something to charge for the mouse. Nice design."
"Dim the mouse, no noise, no light"
"The delivery product is like an illustration, and it's very smooth in the beginning and a few months from now, I don't know."
"Fast delivery, friendly staff, nice, sensitive mouse clicks, batteries and other birth problems need to be watched more."
"Rats use smooth, hand-to-hand, medium-to-quality value."
"The delivery is very fast, the black mouse, the fancy style, and the important thing is that it's very smooth, very cheap compared to the quality."
"Because of disease, it's only been about a month since it's been received. Beautiful mice look sexy, they click, they're just a little small compared to their hands. This one suits girls or hands that are too big."
"Rats use sensitivity, they find good use, they don't know how long, but they're pretty sure with mice, they've got warranty stamps, they've got goodies, they've got goodies, they've got fast delivery, they're pretty happy."
"This rat has an orgasm, tiki delivers it fast again, we put it in the morning, we evaluate 5 stars."
"Nice, soft, sensitive, charged batteries."
"The soft key, the nice color, fits his computer."
"Borrow, nice style, battery charge."
"The delivery was super fast, put the next day there was a nice pink line, a soft mouse, no sound, sensitivity, a very convenient home button."

"The cargo is quite good, the strength is waiting for time sd, trying to develop such rapidity."
"It's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice."
"good goods, let's say that mice are sensitive, tiki delivers fast and packaged carefully, thank you toki"
It's been a long time. It's okay.
"I just got the package, okay. The quality later. Next time, the product's exactly the way he is. The delivery's fast."
"The next day, you'll get it, you'll be quick, you'll fit in, you'll support the shop."

"Nice, fancy, long-term battery, nice to buy or give."
"Fast delivery tiki, convenient charge, good use. The strength needs to wait until the test time."
"Quick delivery shop, carefully packed for 5-year-old shop."
"The pink is so cute. The students like me feel that the mouse prices are so good compared to the quality, they're going to introduce our friends to the shop, they're going to be booming."
"Just got the nice stuff, tried the sensitive keys, ran pretty smooth."
"Conveniently, The Price Is Right"
It's pretty smooth.
Here's a mouse. Okay.
"It's extremely fast. The mouse's sensitive, the baby's using online learning, and she's quite fond of it."
"Nice mouse, no noise on the press, likes to charge without batteries, convenient and easy to use."
"It's nice and it's over and it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good."
Mouse ok
"The rats are smooth and smooth, and they like it very much."
"It's like the wind, I haven't tried it yet, but I'm still giving it five because it's on, and it's on, and I hope this mouse will stay with me longer than it used to be with me."
"Use the right hand, smooth, easy to move, shop's a bit late."
"Nice mouse, the rat isn't very sensitive, it's only taken two days, it's not clear if it's working, but it's okay."
"Pack it carefully, support the shop next time."
Quick delivery.
"Nice delivery, quick delivery, sensitivity, unknown durability."

"This is the first buy, and now I'm gonna go in and buy the second time I've seen tiki remind you. The second girl saw Ted delivering."
She's beautiful.
"The mouse is very popular, the whole house with a very convenient return to the screen, adjusting dpi's sensitivity to all types, and in general it's worth a lot of money."

"It's cheap, so meja's gonna use it."
"Nice mouse, two days of uninhabited durability, but two days of use. Okay."
"The mouse is soft, it's not loud and it's not easy to use, but I'm not familiar with it, so I don't see how it's working."
"Rats are good, smooth, low-industrial, and for this price it's too much."

"It's a little bit more appropriate for girls who don't know what the quality of the product is, because I have to use it to be more valuable, but the bottom line is to get the good stuff."
"Your hand's a little small, you shouldn't buy a nice, smooth mouse."
"It's nice, it's not right, it's been a long time. It's been three weeks. It's twisted, it's not intact, it smells really bad."
"The mouse looks very fine, the pink is very sweet, the color is much brighter than the picture that it takes. Uses two left and right buttons that are almost no-god (small, focused sounds very hard). But the roll is not smooth, but two white buttons on the mouse when you click it out very loud. The tip of the plug on the left side of the mouse is tight but can still be charged with a laptop."
"If the mouse is not good enough, attaching the charge cable to the use, unplugging the charge after the charge will be difficult to control for a moment, and the battery may be a failure; this proves that there is a disparity between products, someone gets a good product, someone gets a low quality product, and suddenly buys a wireless mouse, and now there is a string:D. The choice is to buy another product!"
"If we use less than a month, the battery is not charged, no matter how long it's been charged by the USB labtop gate, now that the mouse is broken, the charge light will not be visible when you plug in the wire!"
"It's not working because the mouse won't get on and the mouse won't get on, and the battery should run out, but it won't work."
"I bought the 21st.11. Is it wrong that the mouse won't pick up the signal. When I open it on, it won't light, when it's bright, it won't move the mouse. It's smooth."
I've been charging for about two hours as a guide. 2.
"Tiki asked if this product is still on board. If you can use it for a while, the battery won't work."
"Rats look good at first, they're good at it, but when they get exactly 20 days, the flash drive's head is out of shape and then the mouse breaks down, like the real code, with only nice bags on the outside."
"There's lots of dust, and they go down, and they're hard, and they have to be shaved every time they're cleaned, so that the bases can smell the rain of the water."
"The middle mouse is heavy, the small size pretty neat ok, fast delivery, will continue to support"
"I used it for a while, I needed to charge more batteries than the last mouse that I bought, and sometimes I didn't take a roll and I took it out on the table, and it was basically OK."
"Soft keys, mouse clicks are fine."
"The mouse works fine, but the small thing that's not happy is it's very smooth to move."
Your mouse's got a bug at the shop. It's impossible to plug in any kind of machine.
"It's a little loud for the old mouse. It's okay to use it without a hard hand, it's a new cable."
"It's only been a day, but it feels good."
"There's still a delay, a lot of times when a mouse won't eat. Two weeks is no use."
"The product I bought for a while saw no control, although the battery was full."
Fast delivery and testing the product for quality.
"The mouse I bought on March 25, the mouse is now out of use, the red led under the mouse has no signal, even though it's checked the battery and the connector."

"The mouse that was spent less than three days was broken, plug in krill and no longer works."
"Fast delivery, mouse, smooth"
Okay.
"It's broken, you know?"

"It's okay, it's not what it's supposed to be, but it's as good as price."
I just spent two days on the left side.
"It's hard to reach, it's hard to lose, it's got a wire on it."

"It's already been cool, it's not even 200K earpieces, it's not too thick, it's like the other video games, and you play these nice bags, and there's a lot of extra accessories, and there's a lot of good sounds, and the bass is not too thick, and you don't know how many other games you play on PC, and you just see this ear that's right."
The good product delivers fast enough sound products accept
"Sounds good, headset's a little loud, so if you're in the audience, you're in trouble."
"Good sound, honest bass full of accessories, especially seal raw, very fond of the trusted salesman, who used HyperX for 800K, and the sound doesn't differ from this earpiece. Maybe it's the best hearing ear in the price."
"Four stars. Good point: live sound, good sound, good audio mics are very good."
"The microphone works really well, if you buy this Lamborghini just to use a microphone that's just like you."
"Your super bass, it sounds a lot, and your head's a little heavy, but it's not heavy, and yet it doesn't have a tongue, so it doesn't lose its wire, but it's a little thin, and it doesn't even have a broken ear, but it's kind of short on the ear."
How cheap is it that you listen to music and stuff about who's still kicking my throat or not over time?
"I hear it's brilliant, you guys."
It's very good. Thanks for the shop.
"The hearing is fine, and the price is very cheap compared to the quality, which I don't know how long it's going to take, but I'm going to be very happy with it."
The super-speed delivery was always set the next day with good microphones for a few days to try to figure out how to evaluate 10/10.
"Quick delivery, good quality, excellent music, worth of money."
The box is brilliant. Listen. It's the star that fits the ear. There's no reason not to buy it at this price.
"It's usually the same thing as being lazy, but it's the first thing you're gonna see is hearing ears."
"It's been served at 10:00 last night, which today has been delivered, and our prestigious Shop is very pleased with the speed delivery product as advertised."
"We've been receiving goods for three hours since we put them, we're using them, we're seeing them for a while, but the quality of perfection is only relative to the price."
"Five stars of game-tempered feeens and singing a capake. That's great, that's great, that's great, that's dark, that's great, that's great, that's great, that's great, that's great, that's great, that's great, that's great, that's great, that's great, that's great, that's great, that's great, that's great, that's five stars."
"The package is fresh even if it hasn't been ripped off, but the package is interesting how well it's packed, and I don't know how it's used yet, but it's still for five stars."
"Get the goods, the right ones, the right ones."
Good.

It's nice to see your mother wearing a gift.
"The product is good compared to the price of money, used to play games, studied onl. OK, it's not appropriate to listen to heavy music."
The product fits the price.
"That sounds good, but there's no gifts, like a commercial and a shop, so I'd like to give you another bag for my headset."
"Headset's good, sound's clear, audio mic's unscramble."
"It's good at the price, it's bad for long-time wear, full access, good products."

"It's cheap, it's expensive, it's a computer, it's a laptop, it's okay."
"Sound's clear, mic's big, ears don't hold."
"Package carefully, fastship"
"Sound's good, bass's a little weak, but if it's within range, the mic's off to sound."
The product looks nice and cool.
"Second buy and then a good max ear, Mr. shipper."
It's the most beautiful product of the model. The game sounds good. It's the best in the price range.
"Good ear on the bass or carefully packed delivery, in terms of durability, it's only a while before you know it, it's the size of a bag of money."
Good package quality. Nice selling house.
"Very fast delivery, sp ok"
"Use it well, fit the money"
It's worth it.

"The product sounds very, very good, but unfortunately, there's no more attention to Thyki's strings than accessories."
"The club's intact, sounds good, none of it's broken or anything's going to support the shop!!!"
It's because it's basically good sound.
"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."

"Well, it's kind of hard to hear on the outside, but it's kind of hard to hear because it's kind of like how the accessor is accompanied by quite a lot, there's a clamp, there's a cable for PC, there's a microphone, there's two mics, there's no idea how long to live."
"Stick to a non-receptive computer. You have to restart the receiver. You have to unrecognizable, unreceptive. You have to restart the headset to pick it up."
"I ordered a PC cable, but the order I got back didn't have this accessories."
"Listen to your laptop for the first time, you're not gonna hear it, you're not gonna hear it the second time."

I don't know why I lost my partner's voice. I can't hear a game. I can't hear it.
"The goods don't have any sound Bass, the quality of headsets doesn't equal the earphones of 50K on the market."
"The quality is pretty good compared to the price, fast delivered."
"The short wire is not appropriate for pc. The biggest subtraction is that the mics don't work, the ears don't fit. It's a lot of disappointment to the product."
The quality of sound is too poor.
It's a little short for four stars with a long cx accessories with a loose wire.
"The product, like the description, the quality, the pain in your ears for a long time, the rest is fine, the price is right."
"I got the product and I saw something that wasn't connected to the PC, and I got it back for a consult, so thank you."
"The sound sounds good, the form is not good, the side of the ear is more likely to fall off."

It's like 20 minutes and it's really hard to hear.
"I've been on the right earpiece for more than a month, and I've lost a lot of voice on the right."
"At this price, I'd like nothing more than to wear it for an hour, afraid to wear it, a terrible pain in my ears."
Nice slow delivery.

It's a little slower than the USB port on my MSI.

It works perfectly on the Macbook m1. Encourages people to use it. It's as good as plugging it in a machine.
"The cable and the plughead both use very solid materials; the transmission from the phone to the device is accurate, and it doesn't go wrong."

"Pack your bags carefully, deliver them on schedule. OK, next time, order from tiki."
"Rats buy at a good time, low quality, low quality, the same kind that used to be bought on Tiki, very unhappy!"
"The quality's poor, the baby's too much, the mouse's got a firm hand, two's a storm in the picture, but in fact it's kind of disillusionment, like fake goods, maybe three or two different days or so, who's going to buy it, so stay away from this mouse."
"Fast delivery (even if it's an epidemic), packing is quite satisfying compared to ***, but only a slightly slow left click to press hard to receive."
"Thanks to Tiki's delivery for the season, we're looking for a few mice and nowhere else to deliver them for dilation."
"All right, let's make a quick delivery."
"When you buy something you've asked for a red bill, you still haven't received a red bill from the store, and hopefully you'll get a red bill soon."
"The good product, it doesn't have a problem right now, just wondering why the rat's bag was cut off first."
"The delivery guy was pretty rude and threw it inside, and the customer who called said where it was supposed to be was angry."
"Yeah, it's the right model, but you're too rough. You know, it's okay."
"The product is too bad, the mouse has gone too far, and it's trashed."
Quality ok
"The quality is unknown, but this time Tiki delivers longer than ever, a week before we get it, we subtract one star."
"I can't use it, I can't light it."
"As to how the package is packed, the bag is still cut, but so far the use is still very good, so highly recommend"
It's okay.
Click the mouse button to stress it. The person who clicks on the mouse office all day may buy another one that is probably more reasonable.
The product is exactly like advertising.

"You're looking at a 53 percent photo that takes almost three hours, sometimes only 41. —> The quality product is unstable."
"It's a pretty heavy battery charge, Wireless. I charge it from 60 percent to 50% in one hour, 15 minutes."
"The charge was fast, but only five months ago, the battery swelled up like it was pregnant."
"For every five encouraging stars already available, there's no limit on how much it's worth."
"The box is a bit of a transport box, packed carefully. All functions from wire to wireless are fine. The quality of the time will answer."
"The battery charge didn't come up, the backup battery went down from 74% to 0%, the backup battery went up one hour."
"Nice stuff, check-out and sign up for online security."

Seeing how to wear and structure is cheap and cheap, not to mention nothing, but to be smooth with ears and ears, it's also difficult to fall while walking, running. So recommend your colleague buys note: wear the outside so it's as big as airpods or hearing ears, but it's safe to move more."

"The original setal, the toolbox shell is not distorted, but the inside is scratched a deep one. The charge is not as fast as the lightning charge, at the heat of the machine. Mn should learn, compare the advantage with the lightning charge line before choosing to buy."
"In general, it's not necessary to use earphones, which you can use while you can use earphones, and it's not necessary to use MPD, and it's very expensive to buy because it's expensive, and it's expensive to buy about 900k versus market."
"I don't know what other iPhone lines are like, I use my iPhone XR, so I don't breathe in my cell phone like an ad."
"The Mini-Term iPhone 13 has case magloven, it's still hot. If it's hot, it's unloading itself -> credits itself and converts the machine through a lightning charge."

"A lot longer than the wire, two hours to charge, 40% of the battery."
"It's the brand-new company, but it's gotta be precise to charge the battery every time you get the phone out, you need to put your hands on the charge to get the phone."
The battery doesn't go any faster than the cable charge.
"Just received December 7, 2021, so checked."
It's still intact and it's beautiful. I don't know why you don't just take your own phone call.
"The delivery product doesn't come with the charge, and the price on it thinks it's going to have to come with the charge, and it's not going to be satisfied with the product ads."
"It's fine, it's weak, it's pretty hot."
"Very good pin tiki Shri, quickly packed package very carefully very pleased"
"Quality charges, whole envelopes, the company itself, but the charge rate will be much slower than the regular charge."
Good.
Tiki is a good support
It's a bit of a long charge. It's a quick package.
It's too slow for iphone 13 prox
"It's too hot, it shouldn't be bought."
The charge is slow and hot. Requesting return.

"Quick delivery, slightly small base."
"Slow down, use the charge line as fast as you can."

"The speed of reaching v30, which is slightly lower, but it's the main row of samsung, who sees slow reading cards because they're slow reading cards, not slow-read cards, but if you want to maximize reading speed, then use the top of the web 3.0 and up."

The product shouldn't be bought if the machine's not compatible read the description before buying the store.

"Since I lost the mouse's PAD, looking for this product instead, I'm also connected to a wireless keyboard, and I'm generally satisfied with the product."
"Used with mouse devices, the unify key of Logitech. Switching back and forth between fast devices is not as late as Bluetooth."
"We can use it well, we can connect many devices, we can use three months without problems."
It's safe to buy Tiki Trading's goods.
"The Logotech Mouse has lost its income, bought this for a tryout. The record is good, easily installed using a download program from the log LPL website."
Use it well with old m238 which has a connection icon. M238 ms will not work. Catching connection pretty quickly
"The delivery is on schedule, the package is nice, it's sealed, it's connected fast!"
"We're good at making quick connections, but we're losing money. We don't have 50 characters. That's why we don't have 50 characters."
It's good. It's good. It's good.

"Min to use the same K400 pluss of logs and smart television but unable to connect, tiki please check and support"
"The delivery isn't exactly the introduction, the full word brand is logoslave, but delivers the logi."
No matching mouse. tiki doesn't support payments. Now let the corner of the house not work. You buy the mouse carefully and see if you have any backup.
"USB Unifying Receiver O connected with keyboards, k220 logs"
"I've received the package, however, I'm not linking this recording to K380Gintech keyboard. I've downloaded & installing software from the Unifydek web site for ON10"
"Tiki Trading, who's the supplier?"
"Nice, small, sound sounds warm, easy bass. Hopefully the battery will be using 12 hours like note of the shop. The quality of sustainable use will only use time to evaluate objectively. It's just a package you should add to the package box that doesn't have an empty package that's less likely to break up."
"I heard 10% of the night, so the battery is 10 percent, so the battery's already in the bathroom."
"The first time I knew about this Anker brand was a backup charge from a guy in the company who showed me eight years ago, but at the time I didn't have the need for a backup battery so I had to listen to it."
"It's been a long time since I've bought Tiki because there's not a lot of discount code, but if you buy it, it's cool."
"Selecting tiki now, since it's close to 3 o'clock, according to plan. Motion B is full waterporama according to information, so it's pretty reassuring to carry the open water, including the pool or the beach."
"I'm pleased, I think I'm the lucky guy to buy a product that can't be better than 4xk, Anker doesn't have to talk about quality, thank you tiki for bringing this luck!"
"Small, small, steady hands, clear sounds, strong and clear, worth buying."
"It's extremely extreme, and it's cool, everybody, and it's so small, and it's so cheap, because it's worth 750k, listening to music, and at such a price, you don't even have to think about it, you know, right?"
"Tiki delivers as fast as she can, on the side of the closed-size speaker, the whole set of kidneys, and she feels good when she opens 60 to 90 percent of the bass is fine, and the battery, and the confidence of the speaker, is to wait until you have a closer evaluation, and at 800K, you should buy it to experience and evaluate it."
Thank you.
Very good quality. Thank you very much.
"It's a little loud and warm, and 60 percent of the time I'm sitting at the table, and it's a little big, and it's Friday at 945k that I saw down to 779k the next day, and I'm crying."
"The cute little design, sure to bring it back, black clean, 12W speakers, so it's not as big as the 16W I used to use, with my ears full of music on the outside, it's much clearer, the bass's good, I bought the speaker and I used 660K so I beat it, but the original was a little bit high."
"It's brand new, it's firm! The quality of good looks doesn't ring, bass hears it, it's too good within a minute. Set 23 p.m. last night before 10 o'clock."
"The product is exactly the way it's described, the quality fits the price, it's very satisfying, the product is exactly what it looks like, the quality fits the price."
Don't know how to activate the warranty.
It's delicious.
"It's nice, it's nice, it's warm, it's smooth. Thank you, owner of the store. It's worth a lot of money for the rice."
"Ankers don't care, but the small speaker that sounds great, sounds great, buys from tiki is even more secure."
"Good quality at price range. Unfortunately, no type C charge"
"Light, smooth goods at a price range. bass is not too strong but can hear it."
"I bought 899k freeships, loud sound, connected to both cell phones and laptops through the blues."
"The product is delicious at a price range. Used to use an ampler, so it's okay."
"Two low-sounders, both high and high, clear and clear."
"Good products, easy to use, neat and convenient, music speakers in living rooms or bedrooms are fine, loud sounds."
"The sound's up, Tiki's up, quality's up."
"Listen to music relax, sound clear, smooth, bass weak, speaker sure"
I've heard it for a very long time.
I ordered the new product that sounded better than I expected tomorrow morning.

"Cara looks good, sounds loud and smooth, sounds like 60% high."
"It's small but it's very good, it's also solid. So after a dozen reviews, I decided to choose aker, although this sample has been out for a long time."
"Batteries are pretty heavy, three-hour charge is full, sound and bass is good."
"Tiki makes quick delivery, big speaker volume, because I'm buying for exercise, so it's OK. I don't have the ability to feel good, so it's very good to see the price."
"It's small, it's martial arts, it's good sound quality, it's good bass, it's a buffalo battery, it's very good quality music."
"All right, well, let's pack up quickly."
Real show.
"It's small, it's loud, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good."

"It's the right sound, it's as small and beautiful as it is in the picture. Okay."
"Fast delivery, Friday at noon, has received a package. The first feeling is small, light-size speakers, pawned with one hand. The box has been removed nsx' stamps and stamps of the dealer. No information and maintenance manuals. No audio readings have yet to be removed from the package. You have an Aker speaker's main speaker shell to preserve the speaker when you go away. When you are in a package with a gift box that is a battery, but only receive a package."

tot
Very fast delivery.
You don't have it yet. It looks good.
"Quick delivery, polite package. OK, but you don't know the warranty?"
Okay.
The quality of ok price only takes too long to deliver it from 27/11 to be delivered by 10ths!
"Sounds good, sounds really good, pack up, check out the goods and get the goods. You should buy them."
Good.
"Fast, enthusiastic delivery."
"Tiki delivers fast, and for me speaker sounds fine at the price, bass is good."
"That's right, sounds good!!!"
"The order's fine, it's a little loud, but it's a pretty good price."
Good stuff.
TERRIA

Sounds warm.
Beautiful.
Fine.
Cara is good.
Okay.

I don't know.
Small but strong
speakable speaker
Okay.
Okay.
I'm fine.
Please.
Okay.
Okay.
"Batteries, loud sounds, or..."
"Cara sounds warm, fit to her needs!"
OK.
Keep the head of the bed tight.
I don't know.
Nice speaker. Sounds good.
"Listen to music at the factory, so use it very well. It's a good battery."
"Bas is a little low. The average sound is pretty good, basically, at the expense. The delivery is on time."
The sound sounds great!
It's a good price. It's a good deal.
"Cara sounds very smooth, new 100 percent, very good quality."
"Good stuff, very pleased with Anker's."
"Good product, bad delivery this time."

"Okay, great bass, not shy when the max volume"
"The tikis are fine, I don't know how the warranty works, but the vote's good."
preferred speaker
I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine.
"The Loa sounds big in a big room and a lot of people, quick delivery, good price."
Okay.
Quick delivery. Sound quality at the right price. bass is fine.
"The product's like a description, but bass's a little weak."
"Advantage: The sound quality is pretty good, can be used for small conferences. Short, flexible in use. Limited: Unremembered old audio quality (3 personal devices) should be less flexible for mobile speakers. Control reduces audio from low-performing computers, wants to reduce sound needs to press directly on speaker. The press inside of the water-proof rubber class should feel a bit heavy. The remote connection and management feature of the Sound source does not work. In nearly 9 percent, the choice is valid."
"There's a problem with packing and shipping that's not good enough, and the package is too messy and the package is too loose to be used, and just put it in a paper box that's soft, and then it doesn't give you a Styrofoam or an extra box of protection."
"And the bass is really bad, and the bass is bad, and the bass is bad, and the price is not the same as the quality."
"It takes 8/2 to get a little while but sympathetic because it's New Year's, the company's whole belts and stamps, but I don't know how to activate the warranty."
"The delivery is fast, but the box has been released before, the package has been used."
"In and out, batteries like a description, I've been hearing small for quite a long time, but the bass is not as high as JBL and Sony."
"After spending almost a year I made the following observation: - Advantage: sound matter good, bass solid, force."
"The delivery guy, like the gang, the bad attitude, the bad tiki service, I'm not buying on tiki anymore."
"It sounds relatively good, but it's a little short of bass, but it's not as good as LG PK3, but it's not as good as it sounds."
"It's a little small for the picture, sound quality's fine, easily connected."
Sometimes there's a loud noise!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Beautiful goods, this price is too good for ae to buy entertainment."
The Loa Anker or the Kien speaker?
"Let me ask you, is Sound Lowe by Anker?"
"Take the quick delivery, pack it carefully, the speaker quality is as safe as an introduction."
The volume is too small to be satisfied.
"After more than a month of use, batteries and bass, everything's fine until it gets sly on one side of the speaker, and I use the speaker to keep it very careful not to open the max, which is pretty disappointing about speaker quality, three stars for the product."
"I'm sorry to hear that the delivery is faster than expected, the package is packed, the price is reasonable."
It's okay to keep your eyes open. I don't know if I'll have to listen to you for a little while before I make another comment.
"I bought it, I didn't see the warranty for the product. Any of you guys have an address or a sdt on the store for me, please."
"It's tight, it's good at the price, but bass doesn't sound good to the brothers who like to listen to vinahouse:D."
Regular kkkkkkkk speaker
Sound quality's fine within the price range.
"We used to use the MotionB speaker, and now we're disappointed to hear that it's not possible to feel a little bass."
"It's not as good as this price and design as it is, it's not as loud as it sounds, but Bolero is very good, just like what he's reading review."
"The package is packed carefully, but the delivery's messing around, the speakers are okay, but the batteries aren't good enough."
"I bought this, but I can't download it. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,"
"The delivery was over 20 days ago, the CSB sent no answer, it wasn't good."
"You know, when you buy it, you don't even notice if he's charging the microphone. It's kind of a shame, he's got a type C charge."
The product's fine. It's like a description.
"In less than two months, we've been playing bass and we don't know if the warranty's going to be sad."
"If you're not good enough, you can send another sp back."
"The line's straight, the music's fine, but I don't know how to do it."
"I don't know what it's like to be a good speaker. I'm using it now, and it's very satisfying."
"Normal sound quality, good battery."
New purchase of rubber legs has been blown up like this.
The quality is normal compared to the price of money.
"Package okie, let's use the time to see how good it is. It's up to five stars."
Normal sounds
Missing card slots
"Well, that's okay. But the microphones are bad. They have to be on the other side to hear it. It's a little uncomfortable."
"I'd like a louder sound, but I'm still happy about speaker level."
It's good. It's good. It's good.
"Good speaker, good price."
"The sound hole is pretty, but there's no volume of the sound button on the speaker and on the window 10."
Okay.
Good.
It's good.
Okay.
"The quality is good compared to the price of money, which will continue to support Tiki."
"Bass is pretty weak for Bose the same size, cheap."
"Listens to music as bad as minimies, the high surfaces are easier to cling to."
"All right, we're good on speakerphones."
"It's loud, but it's not good."
"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no."
"When I got the package, the speaker box was open, suspected the product was used."
That's not good.
"Sells used speakers. Write them, don't show them."
"Positions are smooth, sound's good."
"I've heard a call through sim fine, call the video well within the price range."
"It's a nice watch, it's a quick delivery, it feels good and it's easy to set up."
The watch is good. It's full of skills. Our little girl loves it.
It's a commercial-like pick-up.
What I need to hear is a two-way sound.
"As far as the shop's description is concerned, we'll be supportive later."
The place is packed carefully. The beautiful ssang hold firmly. The screen is very smooth.
"The place is packed, the delivery is fast, the machine is beautiful outside."
"It's a nice watch, it's a good call. It's a nice form."
"The Shop is packed carefully with a nice box with instructions, enough accessories."
It's a perfect model clock for fashion.
Call video ~ and call over sim well
As expected.
It's a great product. It's worth it. It's a good service.
It's delicious.
"It's okay. It's okay, it's okay. It's okay. It's okay."
"Quick delivery, clear call, pretty ok"
"The price is low, the function is high."
good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good
It's cheap. It's good.
A lot of utility functions
Very good.
"Very cool, very smooth, a lot of features."
Good Service
It's good for money.
Quick delivery.
"We've had a month of battery failure, battery charge, no use, battery failure in 12 hours."
"Soft, touchy, there's no language instructions. appstckers run their own ads when they use it, wants to turn off the cost of paying the price."
"Huhu just bought it and couldn't start it, bad luck:"
"It's extremely satisfying to have the product that's exactly the same as the description, the package is solid, it's very expensive, it's fast delivery."
The speaker sounds really good. <i>The package is solid.</i> <i>The full box isn't missing anything.</i> <i>The connection's very sensitive.</i> <i>There's nothing to talk about.</i> <i>It's going to be good.</i> <i>It's going to be good.</i> <i>It's going to be good.</i> <i>It's going to be good for the store and the product.</i> <i>It's going to be good for the next time.</i> <i> <i>It's going to be good.</i> <i> <i>
"It's a beautiful package, it's a gift, it's a solid grip, it's a good sound, it's nice, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good."
"The Shop at TP.H.CM. I've got at BRVT so fast, less than 24 hours had been delivered."
"Got the package and the test box: neat, sure, loud sound Stereo is very good, bass is very deep but a little low. <i>The package doesn't charge, the warranty doesn't have anywhere to send it, if you need the warranty to send it.</i> <i>Where do you need it?</i> <i>Where do you need it?</i> <i>Where do you need it from?</i> <i>Don't you want it, Shop?</i> <i>Don't know where do you want it.</i> <i>Don't you want it.</i> <i>Don't have it.</i> <i>"
"The speakers are very sure, the speakers are very generous, the speakers are always very good at what they are, and the speakers are great, the bass sounds good, the bass listens very well, the connection is very good, the speaker sounds better, the speaker doesn't understand it, it's very impressive, it's going to be supportive at the time, it's very happy with the order."
"The package is packed carefully, the stamp is full of nice speakers, but you don't see the warranty, you buy the tiki three times, you have the back, you have the speaker on your back, you'll be happy to support the tiki long term."
"Yeah, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay."
"Heavy and extremely good-looking speakers. The sound is very good. The sound is strong, it's warm, it's not broken, it's quiet, it's easy. It's 10 meters away in the open air, it's very impressive, it's going to be supportive when you get a chance."
"The beautiful design speaker was very good. The impressive battery was, I used every day about 2.5 hours.50 percent of the volume will be reported in a week. Under 20 percent of the sound batteries are quite large compared to that little body, the bass hits hard but good control, the mid-talble clearly sounds like a five-star ending."
"We've got goods, we've got goods, we've got goods, we've got goods, we've got goods, we've got goods, we've got goods, we've got sound quality, we've got money."
"Quick delivery, carefully wrapped, stamped, sound like a picture, sounds good at the price of five stars."
"Pack it carefully. Without warranty, it's a minus. The product fits the price."
"There's some pictures for you to see who or the music guy is, you know, just buy this one for weight, all kinds of music movies, all the way out of all the cool basss that are so big, it's like, you know, it's like you're always listening to me, you know, try one, it's not expensive for the store."
"They're still sealed, they're also warm, they're echoed, they're 30 percent sound, they're echoed all over the house."
"I always thought it would be so good to buy it online and I'd say it's really good. The bass is so good, or there's three cooks to adjust, or there's really, really hard to buy it."
"Easy connection, loud sound or warm bass, quick delivery"
This is the best speaker I've ever bought. The bass's off the table. It's so perfect.
"The bass speaker hasn't run out all day. It's either worth it, or it's worth it, an ihh, like a movie theater without having to go to a supersonic theater. That sounds great."
"It's a really great thing to say. So the bass has to admit that it's so soft that it's so big that it's worth every sound, like it's all out there in the world, or really it's worth it."
"It's clean, it's nice. It's good. It's good sound, but I think it's a little light. That's a good price. I'm not asking for anything more."
"I've just got the package, the delivery shop, all of a sudden, the package, the loud stereo, it's all unscramble, there's nothing to talk about."
"Good speaker, strong bass, strong bolero, huh, no words OK, the sound speaker is sure, the battery hears five hours, 50 percent of the volume is still more than 60 times the battery."
Got a package from the shop. It's packed thoroughly. It's a very good customer-care shop.
"It sounds good, it's okay, it's good to buy."
"The price is right, the price's right. The price's right, but the stability must wait for the time to answer. The price's right, the price's right, the price's right, the price's right, but the stability's gonna have to wait for the time to answer."
"The quality of the product is better than expected, the price of the price is very good and worth it, let's hope the product lasts."
I don't need to listen to music. It's a big volume. It's worth five.
"Five stars, really surprised at the sound of this speaker, and at 1.390 it's above its expectations, and of course it's nothing compared to the brand and the money, so it's worth 40 meters and it's fine."
"Fast delivery, carefully packed, extremely good speakers, sounds that are already in the shop, extremely pleased with this product from the shop."
The bass is too big or too big to buy another connected pair.
"It's warm, it's... it's got some money, guys. It's all in the room."
The speaker or nothing to criticize the bass tress has to be so smooth that the warm sound is so genuine as the movie theater has three more sound-adjusted modes. The first time I saw the speaker was so good.
The delivery shop is the correct pattern. The speaker quality is good. Sound sounds good.
"It's the biggest music ever, it's really worth the money, it's the music, it's the music, it's the music, it's the music, it's the music, it's the music, it's the music, it's the music, it's the music, it's the money, it's the money, it's the money, it's the money, it's the music, it's the music, it's the music, it's the music, it's the music, it's the music, the music, it's the music, it's the music, it's the music, it's the music, it's the music, it's the music, it's the music, it's the music, it's the music, it's the money. it's the money's the money, it's the money, it's the money, it's the money, it's the money, it's the money."
"The way I see it, this speaker sounds really good. There's a bass that has a full copy. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay."
The room sounds like a movie theater. Does it sound cool or doesn't it make a mistake for a 5-star shop?
"It's really cool, it's like being in a movie theater. It's really, really good."
It sounds good. It's worth money.
I'd say the speaker's fine at the price. It's not a bad sound. It's very high for a 5-star shop with this product.
"Fast delivery of the book after 15 minutes had a sound row: - The bass is strong, sure, to absolutely no agey phenomena - large, bass, pop and bass are lightly packed, and the integrity in your hand is strong, and whether or not it takes some time to evaluate it."
That's great.
"It looks nice and it sounds good, fits the price!"
I heard the owining brothers from upstairs.
"It's cool, the box's a little scratchy, but it's worth 1.590k, and it's great, but the next day it's down to 1,340k, or the sister and the agency ordered it, which is faster than we expected."
"Big, loud, loud speaker, big, big, big, big, fat, big, big, fat, big, fat, big, fat, big, big, big, fat, big, big, big, fat, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big bag money."
The speaker sees a shower of praise should always buy it. I can't believe it's too good at this price.
"Rows, nice package."
Good goods will support the shop
"Good quality, bass or big volum."
"So, compared to the 50W version, this version of this version is better, and hearing that she's no longer going to lose, and the design is quite complete, and I believe in the negative quality of this pkcb line."
"Quick delivery, sounds good, but playing the bass is a little rough."
Used and bought a second one.
That's great. That's great. That's great.
"It sounds great. It's worth a lot of money, rice money and waiting time, quality product at a price range, good stuff for whatever money it is."
It's great. It's great. It's great. It's great.
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.
That's a great sound speaker.
"It's convenient and appropriate, but there's no USB slot, which makes up a memory stick, hearing legs, and charging legs."
What kind of money is it?
"You know, there's nothing on the loudspeaker. You can't get all worked up. You can't get it over with, you know, simple design, but it's really good quality."
"The speaker's good. He's new, he's got full warranty. That sounds great."
The product sounds good.
"Three speakers bought three speakers. Now, let's say one brother bought them."
"Good use, it's been a few months, it's been a long time, bass sounds warm."
"The first time I ever bought a speaker that high, the whole time I was hearing cheap speakers, I'm telling you, this is really different. It's really cool."
They're going to be doing a lot of shopping. They're going to be doing a lot of shopping.
Okay.
good speaker at a price range.
"It's a little low, Bradshaw. It's a good thing."
"I've experienced negatives for two days, and the sound is beyond expectation, and the bass is over, and I've never dared to open the volumus 100%, and people can trust the use with which they can never be disappointed."
"Great quality speaker. Sound's off the table. Loud, loud, loud, stable, travel."
"The bass isn't exactly burning, but as far as the transportation convenient is concerned, it's going to be OKela."
That's a heavy speaker. Don't say it. It's always good enough to get five stars.
"Too brilliant, too loud. Or especially the bass. Sounds like it's always possible to adjust sound in a lot of modes."
"Good goods, pre-support stores, and after an enthusiastic purchase of goods, easy to use, easy to connect the wife of the shop, very safe to use, fun to buy more."
I'll buy this again. Two of the things I'll admit are connected. That's great.
It's a great sound speaker. It's a big volume. It's convenient.
"The sound is bright, bass is stable at a high level of volum, which is a fair price."
"I got the product I bought, and I'm very pleased with the quality of the Shop audio, and I asked why the product didn't see the warranty, so I activated the warranty."
"Quick delivery, beautiful goods, loud and smooth music, and Bass is great."
"Yeah, it's a great speaker. It's a steady phone connection. The battery's about five or six hours old. It's because I'm listening to a lot of power."
"Oh, my God, it's so cool out there. It's so bad in my mouth. It sounds so good to see a seven-year-old."
It's really expensive. It's a great bass. It's a long time. I don't know if it's gonna last.
"Just got the package, sounds good, heavy, sure!"
It's like water.
"It's brilliant, it's very expensive, it's a really good sound effect."
"It's nice and it's warm, it's small, but it's got huge capacity, it's high, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's small, it's small, but it's really cool, it's cool, it's cool, it's cool, it's cool, it's cool, it's cool, it's cool, it's small, but it's huge capacity, it's high, it's cool, it's cool, it's cool, it's cool, it's cool, it's cool, it's cool, it's cool, it's cool, it's cool, it's cool, it's cool, it's cool, it's cool, it's cool, it's cool, it's cool, it's cool, it's cool, it's cool, it's cool, it's cool, it's cool, it's cool, it's cool, it's cool, it's cool, it's cool, it's cool, it's cool, it's cool, it's cool, it's cool, it's cool, it's cool, it's cool, it's cool, it's cool, it's cool, it's cool."
"The good products, loud sounds, fast delivery, new use, so we don't know if they're loud or not."
Use it fine.
"Fine. Speaking of bass, we can't match JBL's prices. Okay. We can't ask for more."
"This speaker buys music or movie practice. It's so cool, it's always so funny. It's always 10 stars."
"I mean, the speaker's okay, even though it's more than 100 anymore, it's great."
"Pack your bags carefully, make sure, the product is properly described."
"It's great, but finding out more and more is exactly the same as the V7 pro Chinese speaker, and xdobo at less than 1 M, I'm putting more Chinese speakers under 1pm in comparison."

"If you have money, you'll do the same thing. Make sure you don't regret it."

"It's a great speaker. It's a good one. It's a good luck to buy it. It's not every time you spend it, it's a good one."

I don't know how long it's gonna last.
Great speaker.
"It's a bit of a dk... compared to the price, but the bat's a pretty small loser to the trosmar."

An elephant's butt.
That's great.
"Okay, good."
"Shellboxes, nice handles, sounds good, bass's tight, but only 80 percent of the volume should be played."
The bass of modeStry bass doesn't sound like the bass of the mode pop in small volume. There's no occasion at all in high volume.
"Let's make a couple, it takes half a day to put together two TWS sets and double the performance of 120W? <i>We need to put together two speakers before you can reach a mobile phone or a computer.</i> <i>Is it possible to hear a couple of speakers a lot better than a speaker.</i> <i>The NGON is a little bit more expensive?</i> <i>I hope to last a long time.</i>"
"I just got the package, and it's really hard to use because the battery will be gone for a while, and the charge will last about five minutes, so I don't know if it's a battery failure."
"Buy it every day, January 17,22, until the time of use, the battery will not enter the power."
"Design OK, sounds ok, but how can you only hear for two hours, charge no lights until they're full?"
"After I put in my 32 g memory stick, all the other memory cards (4g, 8g) won't take it, and now everyone knows how to fix it."
"Good sound, good quality, worth money."
Suppression is fine.
"It sounds good chaqcs, but there's no official warrant for the company, but it's the same thing as xbodo x8. Only 850 is cheaper than a lot of reference."
"That's cool, but it's not as good as PKCB speaker."
"The first feeling of satisfaction is fast and on time, the beautiful product has a box and is packed carefully. Sound quality is heard and quite large. The question is that the name of the product/ brand on the speaker and the guide is different. The warranty does not have enough information and does not have a specific address for the action."
Good at the price range even if it's easy to get dust on the side of the controls.
"Fast delivery, low-cost speakers, loud bass, sometimes oversing the singing, generally for the sole purpose of listening to entertainment, buy this speaker."
"Customers have failed their product because of backup, and there's no answer."
"The Loca recorded 60 watt power, but it's very small, and it's very timid to adjust the volume, and it's not good to hear it."
Sounds good within the price range!
"We haven't been within three feet of each other, we've been in a six-day exchange."
"I've bought an undiluted carpet, so I don't know what I'm talking about. I don't know what I'm talking about. I don't know what I'm talking about."
It's more expensive than any other 200k a.mp.
"The quality's fine, the negative's normal, the battery's long."
Quick failure of quality l
"The battery's a little low, but it sounds like it's worth it."
"I haven't heard it yet, but I don't see any warranty."
"We can't afford one plus battery power, each one of these is out of batteries, buying another one."
I got the speaker but I didn't have the cable to ask why.
"It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's cost."

"After a two-minute break with the music, the speaker shuts itself down."
Not so good after a month of use.
It doesn't sound so good. Turn on the max speaker. Feel like you can't get 60 watts just across the regular smart speaker.
"Well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well."

"Okay, how long can we wait?"
The sound is fine. Think carefully before you decide to buy it.

Sile hunting is worth a lot of money.

"Can't charge, can't turn on, can you please give me another one?"
"The product doesn't charge with C-door cable, just charge it with an iphone."
The C gate is only input so it can't be faster on the iPhone.
"You shouldn't buy it because the typeC port is just non-printing, which means you can't plug in the wire to charge the phone."
There's too much error. The portal charges the battery.
The age of life is down. 4 months.

"The metal shell looks fancy. It's nice to write it so fast, it doesn't break off at all. There's only one point that doesn't like it is the pen to close/open, it's probably going to leave the room falling, but every time it's closed or opened for a long time, it's not going to fit into the other end but it's got to be in its hand, so it's going to be lost."
Sensitive sensors.
"The new feeling used is that the pen is sensitive, it's smooth on IPad and Smartphone, and the ink head on the paper is also very bold and beautiful."
"I'm buying black, I'm drawing fine, I'm fine, I haven't got a screen on yet. I'm starting to learn how to draw a little bit too loud, so I'm sure it's going to be pretty hard."
"Photo medical pens, quite sensitive, smooth touch, low cost."
"The paper is made of metal, and it's made of hand-sharp, and in the box there's a pen-head to replace it with, it's good write-off, it's not good, it's not good, it's not good, it's not good, it's not good, it's not good, it's not good, it's not good."
"Sensitive, easy to use."
"Tikis in one hour, too fast, packaged carefully, well-used product compared to the price of money."
"This pen, which I used for nearly a year, I used for the iPad to feel it's still smooth, and the pixels that I put in the pen are 90 percent better than the pen."
"Nice pen, hand lifting, sensitivity when drawing on the iPad is pretty good."
"It's pretty good for the head of the touch pen, it's probably better for anyone who likes to draw, but it's not okay to write note it, but it's hard to ask for it at a price."
"The need is not to look, I'll write like a mouse and write. not as good as note's main pen but also as good as good."

"Good, OK."
"As good as necessary... will support the shop, Escondido."
"The package is careful, the pen is sensitive, it's smooth, it's extremely pleased."
"The package is very careful, the use is OK, it's very well written, there's one more tip of a pen thanks to tiki so much!!!!"
"Tiki delivers very quickly, but his goods are smashed around: (The paper we use on the iPad is good, smooth and sensitive:> But using on smartphone and the laptop is a little rusty and broken, probably due to inconsistencies: the product is fine, the price is fine for a new person who's first used as himself."
"I don't agree with the product. Write or draw constantly breaks down, sometimes write or draw without eating. And then write on the paper pretty loud, non-sympathetic ink."
"The delivery was three days late, and the pen OK was as natural as the normal pen."
There's an error. One end of the pen doesn't feel. One end of the pen is pretty good. The delivery's pretty fast.
"A pen can be written on ipad, iphone, an interactive laptop. However, it is written on a better iphone. The writing will quickly be lost, so it is slow to write down."
"The tip of the pen is a round piece of plastic, a few millimeters across the screen! The pen is the center of those round plastics! The feeling is not as natural as a pen on paper or Apple Pencil! it's generally worth less than 500K, it's hard to find a sensitive little touch, it's only this round head and rubber heads!"
"Buy SP's main purpose is to use small sensors, to delete objects in the image, when using app edit images on the phone, which end up feeling too big, if the sensor head is so quick, then use your hand to act quickly."
"In order to use the sensor, you have to have a small magnet on your head. Note: head is made of plastic, not metal, like Adonit, but time can be cut off."
"It's boring, it's boring, it's boring, it's boring, it's boring, it's boring, it's boring, it's boring, it's boring, it's boring, it's boring, it's boring, it's boring, it's boring, it's boring, it's boring, it's boring, it's boring, it's boring, it's boring, it's boring, it's boring, it's boring, it's boring, it's boring, it's boring, it's boring, it's boring, it's boring, it's boring, it's boring, it's boring, it's boring, it's boring, it's boring, it's boring, it's boring, it's boring, it's boring, it's boring, it's boring, it's boring, it's boring, it's boring, it's boring, it's boring, it's boring, it's boring, it's boring, it's boring, it's boring, it's boring, it's boring, it's boring, it's boring."
"Nice pen, looks classy. Sensitivity is moderately sensitive, however often writing or embellishing, turns out to be a cut-off. Convenient by making pen-to-peer slow down. At this rate, this Baseus is just right enough, it's appropriate for all of you to learn how to draw the pen, for the people of the office or someone who needs to write the note on the page, the pen meets the demand."
It's all right. It's not very sensitive.
Use it onpad 5. Bad. Nothing to use.

"This price range is OK. Sensitive, easy to manipulate. These are my pictures! Thank you, shop."

Satisfaction
"I'm not used to it, but it's good. It's extremely fast."
Sentimental pens are sensitive and dirty.
should not buy to use write function.
The first part of the sensors is too big. I think it's just a little bit bigger than the head.
"The company itself, it's beautiful, it doesn't work, it doesn't know how sensitive it is!"
What? The pen doesn't take the machine.
It's normal.
"It's a little hard, a little bit more than writing point. Acceptable versus price."
It's not as effective as I expected. I don't know if there's any backup.
"Pens are good, not too sensitive, but they're still useful for basic purposes, like playing games, writing note, and drawing is pretty hard."
"The pen was good, however the lid did not have the lift of the shirt. It took time to find out. It was good within the price range."
The pen grips the hand but the touch on the screen is a bit loud. Turn it around and it's a little uncomfortable.
"It's not very sensitive. It's a lighter, but it's not written, it's not fixed in shape."
"The delivery is fast, the quality of the pen is quite high:3"
"I don't think it's a good idea, but this price is fine."
The pen fits the description.
Pens are fine.
"Why did you put your pens near the week, but you didn't see them? It wasn't packed yet."
"Time and again, you can't eat, you can't take it away."
Nice pen. Nice move.
"What do you think you're gonna do, always like you expected?"
"Writing only lasts a week. No more food, less quality goods."
"It's a pen? It's okay, it's... it's okay."
The product is exactly what it's supposed to be.
"The delivery is OK, the package is fully sealed, fully charged, fully operational until the time of use confirms the quality... of the origin information clearly."
"The order was a little worried, but when you get it, it's okay, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good."
"Before today's Ravedex, this year Covvid's got a little bit of inflammation. I mean, you know, it's been pretty good."
It's pretty surprising that the speed and completion of the product versus the price of sale.
"Tikinow should always be on time. I don't know if it's sustainable, but I deliver it very well."
"The product's OK, the tiki tape's intact, the delivery guy's okay, the delivery's two hours fast."
"It's light and it's quite pleased with the product, fast-loaded, small... packaged, fast delivery, two-hour orders."
"Okie's a cute guy, Mr. shipper, first of all, he's got a brand-new delivery address in Washington, but it's because he's quarantined, so he's moving the delivery address home, and he's still happy to change the address to his cute delivery address, which takes a long time, so that on the 9th day he gets it, and only on the 12th day he gets it, and Mr. shipper is nice to ignore."
"Standard goods like pictures, neat, beautiful products that have been charged, are very pleased with the quality of the product, let's say the shop is getting more crowded and more crowded."
"The product's good, it's not hot, it's quick to charge your cell phone, Tiki delivers 2 o'clock on schedule, good service."
Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.

Let's make a delivery. Let's try it quick. Let's take some time to figure out the quality.
Ada Federov corresponds to a few days-long IQ's high-speed charge so he can't review very much.

"Fast, hot. Use it. Okay, compared to the price."
Okay.
"It looks fine. It's not hot, it's hot, it's hot, it's hot, it's hot, it's hot, it's hot, it's hot, it's hot, it's hot, it's hot, it's hot, it's hot, it's hot, it's hot, it's hot, it's hot, it's fast."

"The brand-new bomb charge that lasts almost a month is broken, asking for warranty and innovation for something else."
"Ip 11 charges more than one hour, and it's only when you charge less than 60 percent of the heater, but it's pretty fast and it's okay to charge at this price."
Okay. Okay.

"Hey, Shop, please allow me to return the charge line."
"It heats up the engine, charges 10 minutes, doesn't go into the battery."
The battery's half an hour away.
"It's been a while. It's a nice package, quality. Okay."
It's about a year out of the question.
"I'm a little worried, maybe the charge isn't Apple's is gonna cause trouble with the battery."
The initial evaluation is good to wait for more
It's boring. It's boring. It shouldn't be bought.
"Nice form, fine charge, not very fast."
The tip doesn't fit with the ip wire. I don't know how to plug it.
"The product keeps on plugging in the power, pulling it back and forth. It's not going to work."
Quality ok
"It's new, so I can't judge it yet."
"Is it okay if I change it? I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, but I'm sorry, it's not a web gate."
It's okay. I don't know yet.
It's two hours fast. It's full of batteries.
"There's no charge, so we can't use it yet."
It's not organized with my GRI J6 model

The keyboard definitely doesn't have lag. It feels better than the KM 3xx also with Dell's 600K after more than a year.
The good stuff will buy it back when it fails.
"Queen's keyboard, sure."
Good.
"Everything's fine, except for one thing: the two lab batteries are broken, the water's wet, the one corner of the box, which doesn't affect the device."
I bought a KM5221W that delivered KB3121W last time I bought one of those at KENVUSTORE.
"First of all, the packaged product is very sure, tiki delivers it carefully. The box is still intact. It's not distorted. It's very fine."
"It's a big, fancy product, unlike the little ones that used to buy very good materials, that are able to adjust the altitude so that it's possible to raise your hand to the compass and type a keyboard, and it's also accompanied by a screw that can be squeezed or loosened very carefully."
"Fast delivery, very heavy lifting, very good quality, so it's hard to adjust the angle, so you don't have to worry about loading when you put it on."
"I've been thinking about buying a piece of Tiki or buying another product that's higher than the other side because this is the first time I've put Tiki, which is amazing. <i>I've got nine o'clock in the morning.</i> <i>The most important package, the safe one.</i> <i>The price is very sure.</i> <i>I'm going to use for Macbook Pro 13> <i>I'm not going to be able to buy someone else!</i> <i>What I care about most when I buy.</i> <i>You're going to pay for.</i>"
"It's certainly hard to recline behind, if it's only 16 inches, but the avoidant is so short that it's so short that it's so easy to slip if it's too flat-lined and it's too flat."
"Feelings are much more stable than the cheap line bought at the market, the cable is not afraid of falling off at work, suggesting buying more left-hand keyboards to optimize the product's energy and solving the spinal and back pain problem of the office."
"Sure, hard-core, used on a 15-six-pound laptop. It's about 12 pounds, but it doesn't shake at all."
"It's the right aluminum block. it's not the same iron, it's the right quality, it's the right stuff."
"It's good, it's hard, it can type a laptop that doesn't ring, it feels good, it's quick delivery, it's very buyable, it helps the neck a lot when you use your laptop."
"It's steady, it's nice, it's 15 inches low, it's a little bit light, it's a little bit light, it's high, it's heavy, but the quality of the product is worth five stars."
"That's what it's worth, quality, luxury, and most importantly, the neck of the hunch office."
It's pretty solid and beautiful.
"Hard cable, good design material, if the border below the laptop that cuts CNC looks like a top wall, it's perfect to be friendly with the hand."
"Sure, light"
"Let it be beautiful, dignified, and sure."
"But if you use subface, it's a little short to help, I have to make one more cover."
"It's a little too heavy, but it's a little thick in the room, and it's a little bit thick in the middle."
"The neck's salvation during the stretching season, the solid price, the height of the max, I think it's about 50 centimeters, it's a little rough, but it's a good thing."
"Right color, sure, hard-looking pattern-like image."
"It's solid, it's tough, it's worth it."
"Good product, aluminum solid, nice, packed goods, quick delivery!"
"The design price and the beautiful color, it's solid, it's neat."
"The delivery is faster than expected, the package is very good, and the price is good, and it's very sure, even though you're a big, heavy, old type."
"The product can't get anywhere from design to color, sure, convenient luxury."
"The fine, shining hard quality"
"Sure, neat, easy to move"
Beautiful goods are definitely cheap.
"Please, be sure, the delivery is two days faster than expected."
I think I'm going to feel better with this laptop on my back.
Perfecting production is good.
Okay.
"Quick delivery, steady product."
SP is definitely very convenient.
The completion of the material is very certain.
"It's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's beautiful, and it's solid, it's solid, it's five stars."
"Quick delivery, nice package, sure."
The price must be as good as you'd like it to be.
Okay.
Very sure and exactly the same.
Great.
"It's solid, it's tough."
It's the only thing with proper warranty on it.
"The joints are solid, a 2-pound laptop is fine."
It's beautiful and sure.
"Take care of the package, use it well"
Good Use

"Sp sure, nice, quick delivery"
Sure.
"Good quality, should buy"
"The product is sure, the levels are high, the money is worth it."
"Good product, well packed."
"The price is solid, beautiful, worth money."
The beauty of the beauty of the product is well-finished. It's worth almost 500k.
I'm pretty sure.
"Computer Taker Price, Couldva, iPad, Macbook Supremeity is amazing."

Good product.
"The good product, the right model, I'd love to, and I hope the store stays on."
"Quality product, extremely good quality at price range."
Beautiful and sure.
"When you order it online, it's up to h."
It's good. It's good. It's good.
"The price's solid, the color's very bright and the color's beautiful."
Very pleased.
"Sure, nice."
"Okay, it's nice, it's hard."
Good.
"Sure, it's cold, it's nice, it's still good."
"Sure, pack carefully."
It's beautiful.
"It's worth it, it should be bought."
The product's fine.
It's very strong.
It's very good.

It's okay. It's okay.
"The overall model is good; the beautiful pattern, the high completion; it looks very prestigious, but there's one thing that looks like if you put it up and you type it, you're going to have a touch of the screen; you've also managed to pull down the lowest level to type it, but you've still got a lot of different terrain, but if you put it away, you've got to use a loose keyboard and you don't touch the computer, it's very good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good to see, it's also neat."
"The good point is to make sure and change your slope, so keep the machine steady at a fixed position. The subtraction is to adjust up and down hard. So this is going to make the machine amplification, rather than typing it, it's going to ring, it's best to use a loose keyboard that's going to be easy for the hand. If there are many people with it, it's not easy to change altitude and there's more expensive choice for the machine to do the job."
"With the dress, with the hand twists, the quality takes some time to figure out what to do."
"Who wants to buy gray, the gray of the shop is green, not as gray as the Macbook color, which is bad."
"Sure,"
"The correct model, the hardness, the strong base, the weight of the heavy laptop, comes with the screws, the products that are worth buying."
"The hinges are hard, solid, good surface quality, which doesn't seem to be rusted, but when you put your laptop up and type it, you have to shake."
I don't know if it's because I pulled it up so high that the price of it shook so hard.
"The product if there's a smarter design that folds smaller and smaller, it's amazing."
"Nice, sure, delicate cutter, unfortunately the silicon patch covers the bottom slightly smaller (or less), smaller laptops have to paste more"
"The board with the channel steam, I don't know how to adjust it."
"Sure, nice."
It looks like Fake didn't have a logo called a storm that used to buy.
"Sure, tough, but the edges are still a little sharp, right for the price."
"Pretty good, I guess."
Packing surely works well for heavy computers but does not fit because it is quite heavy
"The price is certain, adjust the height accordingly, deliver fast, the price of competition"
Channel air output:(()

Manually used.
It's a little jumpy.
"Cool, two-headed wire, so Jack's gonna have to change into one head."
"It's a little late for delivery, it's good, it's basic, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's bad, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's bad, it's a little bit scary."
The sound button clearly indicates that the light weight adjusts the size of the size. The quality corresponds to the price.
"The sound's okay, but it's a little painful for a long time, so you can take it off so you can get your ears off."
"Quick delivery, perfect model."
"Sound products are stable, light, long-term without ear pain, generally quality."
"product looks like a commercial, quality, unrecognizability."
"It's a great shop. It sounds good. Now, how long can it be? Hope it's sustainable, it's beautiful, it's delicious."
"Quick delivery, earpieces of the same log company."
"Good sound quality, long wear, no ear pain, thank you shop"
"Good for the price of money, no ear pain."
"Sound good, mic's good, pattern's good. Okay."
"Quick delivery, carefully packed, just the right kind, long earaches."
"Good quality at price range, bass sound fine, mic good."
"Sound sounds good, light, no heavy head."
Tiki delivers on time.
"Good, smooth ears, no earaches, no sound, excellent, worth the rice."
"I just got a delivery, a little remark: beautiful good, very good, fast delivery, worth five."
"The best sound is low hearing, no neck pain."
"The delivery's on time, sp's on."
"It's beautiful, it's very solid, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good."
"It's good, it's tough, it's not good, it's tough, it's not good."
"Good hearing, sound, will continue to support Tiki."
"When I bought it, I didn't notice that it only had one sense of putting both speakers and mics in it, and it didn't plug into a bug PC at home -- it was OK."
Okay.
"Sound OK, fair price"
Good.
"It's not short, people. It can stretch both sides. It's not too tight, it's not too sound."
"Good product, quick delivery, but still no GTGT bills."
It's good. It's good. It's good.
"Quality goods, delivers at the right time."
Okay.

"Good, good, good, good, quick delivery, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good."
It's okay to use both to listen and to speak.
The package is well packed.
"Unchecked, fast delivery, correct brand, pattern."
"The good products, the sound, the sound, are consistent with the price of money."
It's totally satisfying.
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.
"Quick delivery, call sounds good."
Accept at Prices
Good at price range.
It's better than expected.
It's better than the price.
"I've got a cut on the payments by Moca, and 250k, and I've got a lot of conversational hearing, and many people have noticed that their voices are bigger than their previous headsets."
"The package's okay, packing and shipping, okay, because the headset's cheap, the mic's fine."
"The delivery was fast, but I opened the box and I found that the box was distorted, pasted with sloppy tape, plastic, basically like taking stuff and packing it and then selling it, and I sent the picture, and I needed a clear answer to this product."
"The sound quality of the speaker and the microphone are good, but the microphones aren't completely loud and long-time, but it's also possible they're wearing glasses, so they're more likely to have ear pain, and they're more likely to have a mild product, a sound quality, okay, that's easy to use."
"Buying at home to work ok for more than 200K, light headset earpieces, and a control key to use new mollusk online. I don't know how to use these two foams."
Shiper communicates with the phone unclearly about the time it takes for guests to wait and contact back and forth several times.
"The earpiece doesn't feel an earache, the sound is stable, the wallet is right, the delivery is fast, the package is packed carefully."
"The hearing ear won't take it when you plug it into your laptop, only when you plug it into your phone, buy it to teach online, and it's broken. I'd like to ask you to return the package."
"Nice design, looks like the operator but the earpiece is so small that it doesn't respond well to music because bass is weak and without sub."
"The need for this person to buy this is to teach him online English. The advantage is: - Good Lobo (not knowing how long it takes) to use a few days well. - Mic is comfortable, loud filters are good for learning English) - Small is quite suitable for girls. - Hold your ear when you wear it. Tip: - Because design in the form of hearing class should be really hot and hot. especially for you to sweat oil. - The design is pretty loose (with this amount of money is not expected)"
"The mic's too small, it's really too small, it's got to keep your mouth shut. No one's wearing it with their hands and mics to say, it's a little disappointed at this price."
Tiki's request for a transfer.
"Sound sounds OK, the pressure to the ear is a little heavy, it's about 15 minutes long, it's a little short."
"I bought that PC, I couldn't use two functions, I spoke at the same time."
"If you use them for telesales, you shouldn't buy them, because the noise filtering is not good."
Use very much
"Sound's stable for price, mic's good, delivery's good."
I've responded to the sale so far that tiki hasn't come to pick it up yet.
"Mic is very small, request to return it immediately after receiving the goods and then tiki doesn't deal with it, give it back to the client."
It's very small. You have to keep your mouth shut.
"The mic when it's recorded, the sound's fine."
"The Mick takes out the noise, I hear."
"The quality of sound is pretty good, the microphone, which I've been using for almost eight months, and I've been feeling sustainable, but the biggest weakness of the headset is to just wear for 25 to 30 minutes, and you're going to feel really uncomfortable and hot, maybe because the ear is so hard on the ear, and the ear foams squeezes directly into the ear, not the kind that surrounds the ear."
"I'm sorry, did you just buy it today, fast delivery, but you just bought it, did you get it in your ear?"
You have to sit in a really quiet place before you can record your voice well.

"The quality of the wire is OK, but the wire inside the wire to hold the clock is a piece of glue. The idea of the SS G Fit 2: In later versions, the SS should have designed a lock like a traditional leather watch. The design is bad because the mine hit the skin in the hand and when the movement or the movement of the string is loose and the direction of the hand should very easily fall off the watch. the SS itself has fallen out of the hand three times, but I am walking or I am on foot."

But the car keys to the screen are still scratching a pretty long way (for three weeks).
"It's very uncomfortable to wrap it up with a smooth screen, just like this company's fingerprints on it."
The product isn't exactly like the advertiser who doesn't sneak up on people who consume it in general.
"The glass's scratched, the price's high, the quality's not good."
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!
I don't know if it's real or fake.
Glass OK but paste on screen blur
That's good.
"It's nice, it's on the phone, it's got a discount code from the shop, so it's worth it."

"If you're not sure, the base shift is a little bit charged or you're informed that you're going to fail and fall, you're just going to buy it. If you're going to quickly charge it, and if you're going to build it at facetime with your friends, you shouldn't buy it. Every time you fail to fail, you're going to be the person next to you. Ask the store for support, but it's easy to fall, you're just going to build it, you don't understand anything."
For the verger can't really rule out but that's common to the thing being miserable.
"The charge and the bomb in the box needs Type C to Type C, but for the USB-A to Type C wire, now that you have to buy another string, it takes time to find out what's going on."
"It's completely useless for an iphone 12 (pro/promax) to charge all night not to get up. Apple watch SE up very slowly overnight only about 30 percent electricity in enough for one device, to heat it up, not charge it."
"I've bought 20 minutes of cash and I'm still slow, and I'm afraid the machine is broken, so I'll try it twice, and then I'll throw it away, and it's a waste of money."
"The phone charge's okay, the clock's bad, the time's not right."
"Need to consult how to use... not charge like advertising, to return the product or the product."

"You can use C to C, but you can't charge the wire."
"Hard to charge, 12 Prox charge for a long time, but not full of batteries."
"I got it, but I didn't get it as fast as a regular star shop."
"The impact is extremely slow, the Excelsior Watch doesn't have a battery in six hours."
"I'll take that as a yes, but the speed of charging is fast if I use the 12W drive."

"This is nice, Mom, but if you can take it off just your watch face and wrap it in anaphylaxis, it's convenient to wear it in front of your chest, and then I'll put it into a normal watch, and I'll evaluate the five stars because the store is so passionate."
"So chat with the shop for advice before you buy this product, which I'm satisfied with, this one I took when I first bought it, it's been half a year now."
Okay.
"The product's pretty good compared to the price, but the ripper's an extremely uncomfortable attitude, hoping never to see this ripper again twice."

"Frequently, there is, there is, there is an average, from 40 degrees down to 29,5 degrees in non-air, there's no noise, there's a heat report on the metal surface, and of course it takes time to evaluate more."
"After a while of use, I'm fine, it's not very cold, but because sp is cheap, I can't ask for more."

"Used regularly, once a week charge, good mouse experience, which is worth the price."
"Light press keys, no noise, no beauty style. ex: moving slightly lower, not very smooth, Total: 9D"
"Rats are a little hard to handle, maybe not familiar and a little heavy, not fast response speed."
"After two weeks of using it, you shake, you walk away, you want to eat."
"It's good, it's good."

"Shop's missing an ear canister, addable shop."

"I ordered the package on the day because Tiki Now on delivery and packing of tiki, it's high-quality."
The initial keyboard failed to connect via USB receiver. Tiki supports quick innovation. The keyboard is very fine. A nice light switch. Two connections: over web receiver or blues. I use this keyboard for macbook and computer for window desktops. The switch button uses very quickly and intuitively.
"The product's very good, the price's reasonable, the delivery's quick, waits time for it to last, the product's very good, the price's right, the delivery's quick, waits for time to see if it's sustainable."
"It's perfect for the keyboard. Light, puts it into a nice backpack. Smaller than your old keyboard should take some time to get used to it."
"The keyboard is thin. Although thin, the key route is not shallow, typing pretty little noise"
"I'll buy one for you, and then I'll buy another for you."

"Unlike expected, there is no such thing as a keyboard background light"
"I just got a day of complete disappointment with Logotech's product, lost a million dollars, put it in three separate compartments, get it out in the morning, drop off a few Fs, think it's normal like any other keyboard."
"Emphasis, light, nice, good typing feels good. Comprequently for VP people to use points except for phasers, connecting web to use unify, having to install new apps to use, k plugging the top of usb is working, and most of the company will not allow apps to be installed, it turns out that DSlP = off."
Why don't you see a flash drive with a manual?

"It's a little longer than three or four hours, because of the movie coming in, the headset box charges one time using more than a week, and it doesn't run out of batteries, unless it's a long time since it's been out of connections, it's got to be in a box to get it back together, it's a Chinese scandal, and one of those are in English when it's connected, it's kind of funny, it's okay."
"Good quality hearing ear, lots of bass, smooth sound, long-term battery, good Bluetooth connection, no problem trying to go around the house."
"The battery is so good, I've got a full battery and I can't hear all morning and afternoon without the battery!"
"In general with the price of the money, that's okay with me."
"The product fits the price, the sound, the music doesn't work very well."
"Good product quality, just like advertising, fast delivery, good product at the price, mn should buy"
"You can't use either side at the same time, you can hear the sound."
"You can't connect Cid, you can't speak English in Chinese."
"Quality OK. Light, fair price."
The quality of sound is good. Hears almost an hour and a half and runs out of 30 percent of the batteries.
"It's nice, it's nice, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good."
"It sounds good, but it doesn't make sense, and people sound weird using speakers."
It's a very quick battery.
Very nice.
I heard you didn't buy it. Listen to me. 30 minutes of het bin.

"It's about 63% worth of battery, and it's not until two ears charge one hour that the left ear is charged, but the battery is wired, and it's not connected, and it's down to 0.5 in less than 2 hours."
"The problem is that the battery only loaded 60 percent is not possible, but you think it's only been spent for two weeks, it's not working, it's not working, it's not working, it's not working, it's not working, it's not working, it's my fault it's my fault that the store has time to pay if the product is wrong, but because it's wrong to buy it for you, you don't use it for more than a month to get it out of the box, so now you can't blame the store!"
"There's no branding, made in China that describes products as VN brands."
What's the warranty on one side?
"The product cannot be heard at the same time as the sound of two earphones, and the connection to JPD A73 only hears the sound in the left ear, and the connection to IP14 only hears the sound in the right ear?"
"I don't know why you got two separate blues, one ear and the other dead and the other."
Sometimes it's hard to move from English to middle - language.
"Right ear can only hear the right ear, the battery is only on the right-hand side, recommending that the store be changed, and this experiment is boring."
"At the right-hand side, you're hearing an automatic silence, your ear is torn."
"You can't hear me on the other side of the phone and you can't tell me that you're being shy, and you're wasting your money."
"The left earphone's broken, the battery's gone in five minutes."
"Dock charge at the time of the battery, when the battery's down, the battery won't be charged for a few minutes."
It's easy to fall when you're wearing earphones when you're listening to music or walking.
The earpiece's broken in one of the left ear.
I can only hear you on the right side of my ears. How can I change my product?
There's a lot of mistakes. The unplugged charge has to rewire itself.
"Unlike the description, the battery uses about an hour and a half to cover it."
"There's no answer from the shop, there's no point in contacting the shop."
There's only one side that can hear and the other can't hear.
There's no answer from the phone. No answer from the phone.
"The product's terrible, it's terrible."
I can't hear you. What's up with the phone?
We're listening to nature without a charge.
There's only one ear.
"It's big, but the battery's too low."
I can only hear one side of it.
Sounds good at the price.
It's better than I thought.
It's as good as advertising.
"Oozaru, that's good."
Too Small
"The battery's fast, it's heavy, but the quality's gonna take a long time to figure it out."
"The product that's got the lid on it, it's still out there."
"Okay, good use of sach is fast, too."
It hasn't been long since the batteries and the buns came out.
It's not as if it's in a bad image.
"The package is definitely sealed, the company's brand is full, it's easy to use, wherever you go, it's convenient for you to listen to your call, your location is fine."
"Thank you. The white wire that broke up the battery, it's still running, it's just not knowing how long it's gonna last."
The sims need to reset the clock to get sim.
"Got two for the two kids at home, and the machine works, and it works, and the battery only gets 0%, so once we've checked it, the sims have to open the hatch below it's a bit complicated, but the shop's instructions are okay."
"Got two for the two kids at home, and the machine works, and it works, and the battery only gets 0%, so once we've checked it, the sims have to open the hatch below it's a bit complicated, but the shop's instructions are okay."
"Packaged well, received goods as well as photo, hand-sharp for 12-year-olds, apps are easy to install, like the instruction videos are very fast installed, the prestigious shop, takes more time to evaluate the shop."
"If you buy a cheap watch that's more expensive than a watch, you should sell it with sim, or show your parents how to buy a regular sim vina."
"You know, there's a sos button, you just have to call your mother, because you're young, you can't read, you can't read it, you can put it on your hands, you can't afford it, you can't afford it, you can think about it, there's no mother like you."
"The goods, the prices, the goods, the goods, the goods, the goods."
"The attitude to serve, to support, and to care for customers is very good, to have a positive interaction and to assist in solving problems in time, to be content."
Line OK.ship fast. set sim up OK. Volume ok.mj is very pleased. Matches the price.
"My son likes this watch. Thank you, good luck at the shop."
"It's like a description. Support shop set up very quickly. Thank you. Good support, quality watch batteries."
"A nice, healthy watch, a nice show-and-telling store, will buy you more green for the boy, hoping to get a discount from the store.hi."
"I've been good at using speakerphones, bought a birthday gift for a fast support shop. If you'll excuse me, I'll buy it again. Thank you. Thank you, shop."
"The Shop delivers the right model of quick delivery, which is pretty cheap for the kids."
"You see the new model should buy two, you get a little discount from the store, you don't know the quality, but it's nice, it's good."
"You see the new model should buy two, you get a little discount from the store, you don't know the quality, but it's nice, it's good."
"At first, online purchases were afraid of bad quality, but they were very pleased."
"Loud, clear, listening function is also very clear, but the image is a little fuzzy, the location is exactly 90 percent accurate, buying this in general."
The blue is very nice. The quality shop support clock is quick. I'll be happy to buy more.
"The clock's fine, it's easy to use."
"buy two very good uses, fast installer support shop"
It's a beautiful little watch. The house likes pink. It's got big hands. It's got a reasonable price.
That's what it looks like. Quick delivery.
It's good for kids.
"It's OK, my kids love it."
I'm very pleased with the Q15 smart watch product.
"It's beautiful, and it's OK."
"It's so beautiful. Thank you, shop."
"Fast delivery, product exactly as described, quality."
The clock is good. He loves it.
It's been a while since we've evaluated it. It's called loud.
"The correct product, properly sealed... is waiting for the period of use for further evaluation."
It's a pretty nice-looking watch. She's got a big call on her hands.
The price of rationality is fine.
Satisfaction
It's not installed yet. It's okay.
"Hang ok for the price of our daughter's love, so give her a hearty consult."
Sp. OK.
Quick delivery.
sp tot
sp ok
Okay.
"It's a nice watch, it's a loud call, it's a loose frame, it's open to sim, it's like a baby toy, it's all dead."
"The image-like form. The apple tray inside, the sim tray is not easy to mount. The quality fits the price."
"The Shop is very supportive. It's because the product's low on information, so it's a little hard to understand."
"The electronics that don't spend every day cost the sim 250an. No, you can't use the day. You don't know that."
It's still unacceptable to have a buy-in knife that can't be used.
You don't buy attention when you lose the wave.
The product that's losing power shouldn't have bought it.
"The clock doesn't ring, it sounds small, goes to school to pick up the kids, calls me and I don't know if there's a call."
"It's a poor old battery, so it's switched to this one, but unfortunately the battery doesn't last two days, it has to charge every day."
The clock can't hear and the battery won't come up after two months of use.
"If you open the cap, you're so full of crap!"
Shop should include detailed instructions on how to connect to the phone.
It's hard to buy a sim that can't be used for a three-week store. It's not going to change.
Quality that matches the price of money.
"The battery's too weak, the battery's half a day out."
Adjusting time and installing sims is not working.
It's not good. It's a month from now.
"All right, the battery's gone. I'm gonna need you to take care of the package, which is a quick delivery package, package the box."
Why don't they lend it to him?
"It's a good call, but the batteries aren't good."
"It's not perfect, it's cheap."
It's pretty good. It's quite satisfying.
"DDDy connected to the delicate battery, removed the broken sim."
You can't just buy new sims. You can't just put them in.
It's kind of hard to use. It's got one battery.
too bad to install sim all the time just to report an error
() Uncalculated ratings. Very bad for not being told not to listen
"It's not enough with 4Gs of 4Gb/30 days, but it's not enough to count as 133 Mb per day to read the newspaper, and it's not enough to use 4 Gb until the next month to have 4 Gb to use it, and it's up to 299,000 dollars a year, so it's my personal opinion, and it's up to everybody else."
"I take it every day, thanks to my favorite store to activate the sim, thanks to my extra notes, so the buyers can be confused after getting the sim and finds that sim isn't activated."
"Sim received that the SlM had been used, the Internet was unstable at 4G at 3G and at some point H+ to compare me to the SlM 4G and MobiFone, but it was the exact opposite."
"This afternoon it's time we use it as a commitment, it takes a year to figure it out."
Sim just bought it in September and now he's not online.
Write a description of the product after 4gb/ day. Read it and then buy it; buy it as 4gb/ month.
"This isn't pre-activated counseling, it's just waiting for a new client to activate. It's okay."
I can't take down bandwidth just to see it. I can't use it.
*** sim does not have a network
"One day's use, no more data."
Use it well.
Sim must be okay.
Sim's too weak for four hours.
"It's not working, it's not working."
"Standard supplier, just as you introduced the product."
Complicated! Text unactivated sim
It's good. It's good. It's good. It's good.
Very pleased.

Adhesions are solid.

"It's a very good price, quick delivery shop."
It's very convenient.
"He's got a lot of wires at the same time, clean houses, he likes it, he pulls three meters."
It's glued.
Good product.

I bought it early 2023 and I'm still on it.

I've used a good clock so far.

Please.
Fine at a price range... but not as sure as the last one that bought... good skin... nice home...
"Good breathing quality, second purchase of a shop and still satisfied."
"Good, quick delivery."
"The commercial on the image is made in Korea, but the delivery is made in China. The back one is not the apple that's sending back the apple that's behind the quality that doesn't look like an ad."
"The sense that the quality of the peacock is not equal... and the color of the purple is stronger than the color of brown... and the brown quality of the peacock is less, and it's a little more loose."
"It's weak, but acceptable, skin material."
It's too weak. You shouldn't buy it because the sticker keeps slipping.
Standby.
"I can't eat it, but it's delicious."
"You back up your sims very quickly, and you can get them in."
"Many times we've bought a shop, this time we'll continue to support it."
It's high speed. It's good to use. Okay.
Good service.
"Took two days and felt good, shop."
Okk
"The super OKi keyboard at the cost of money. The keys are almost exactly the same as your laptop on which you type your hand. The round key type is quite fancy, the depth of the key is right for you, neither too shallow nor too deep."
"It's still pretty, but it's not loud, it's fun, it's a long-term battery, it's not good enough, it's good enough, it's good enough, it's good enough, it's good enough, it's good enough, it's good enough for you to buy it."
"The good stuff, the good stuff, win10 gets fast, at this price range is too good, hopefully the battery will last a long time."
"The normal typing keyboard, the keyboard is a little bit farther than the laptop key, so you're not used to it at first. You just don't know if this character is too dim, you don't know if the other colors are like this. You don't have to turn off the source button, you don't have to turn off the screen. In general, you're going to give 8/10, you're okay at the price and you're going to consider what you're buying."
"The soft touchable keyboard is given batteries, but the head is not smooth, so it doesn't draw in hard, and the laser is only two ends, so it's not very flexible. The keyboard doesn't even have a prtscrat button to take a screen shot, so it's too good to use another shortcut."
"The beautiful, light color keyboard, the hard-core material is also a light, touchy key, the strongness has to wait one more time. There's a battery available, there's a tip web attached to the computer like a mouse, this isn't a CAD keyboard, so you can remember to notice. No switch off, but I read the instructions to see how there's a battery-saving self-saving diet, and this should be tracking a little bit more time for the battery like this."
"The keyboard is looking to the extreme, but it seems like the ink is a little distorted, but the whole thing is okay, it's okay, it's cool, it's typing with the keyboard, it's always smooth, it's sound. it's cheap, it's okay, it's not too tight about technology, it's worth buying."
"It's very nice, it's very soft, it's really cool, it's really cool, but it doesn't work for the Ipad."
It's very pretty. Buying white has to be hard to clean. <i>That sounds fun.</i> <i>Let's think about it.</i> <i>There's no button on/off.</i> <i>There's no pin.</i> <i>There's no pens.</i> <i>So anyone should use it before they buy.</i>
"Normal completion quality and uncertainty. The design is not reasonable, for example, for the key to increase volume or use but must press Fn + the feature key combination. While the key of the function key is very few (F1 F2...)"
"The key is very smooth, very low, the delivery is very fast, the white is very pretty, sticker is cute."
"The delay of the date (and I also find it strange that Tiki was always on time before or on time, not late: () just type the normal text, such as increasing the volume, increasing the brightness, is not available; it's pretty, but it's also cheap; it doesn't require much:((()"
"It's a broken-up, stick-up, straight-up, colory thing that looks like a kid's toy on the side of the road, but like that. The battery spring is loose, and it's loaded with batteries. Fast delivery, packaged goods, but backspace's pretty loud, and it's not sustainable. For five stars, it's easy to use and fun."
"Ship got it yesterday, got it, got it, got it, got it, got it, got it, got it, got it, got it, got it, got it, got it, got it, got it, got it, got it, got it, got it, got it, got it, got it, got it, got it, got it, got it, got it, got it, got it, got it, got it, got it."
"The hot keyboard, which is good for use, but the area knows if it's sustainable."
"It's really quick, it's nice, it's cute, it's nice, it's cute, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good."
"I bought it on October 23rd, and I found out it's not working for ipad, and who's looking for an e-mail?"
"A light, non-sounded, fast connected keyboard."
"Since the order is at the moment of Saigon dilation, the order at GNTK is a bit of a long delivery, and the battery is attached, and it feels light."
"I've been waiting a long time for delivery, and she's finally back, and she's got four stars, but let's have a nice five-star keyboard."
"After watching everyone's review, I've got the guts to buy it, it's very satisfying, it's worth the money for the rice that I just used today, and I don't know how long it's been."
"It's pretty, but I didn't notice, so I realized there wasn't a power button. I hope the battery doesn't burn too much."
"I'd like to buy white, I'd like to look at the blue matcha and buy it, but the color is a little bit thicker than the picture, but it's still beautiful."
"Yesterday, we got the order, we got the keyboard connected quickly, and I don't feel like I'm familiar with it."
"It's nice, it's nice, it's not good, it's not good, it's good, it's good. It's not good."
"Beautiful row, light press, sound tone, touch keys... point 10 quality (NHS)"
"The price of nuts for the wireless keyboard, which is a very fine color for online work, unfortunately one point is that no button is turned off to save the battery."
It's pretty ok.
It's a nice little smokin' keyboard. It's still out of batteries.
"It's a super-beautiful keyboard, and it's a super-beautiful press quality."
I hope it's worth at least a year.
"Nice keyboard, which is really cool, but there's noise, and there's noise, and it's crazy, and Tikinow delivers super fast, including cn."
So buy it. The price is expected to last forever.
"From t8 to the end of the t10 meters received sympathy from translation, so that's okay. It's good. It's good."
"The package is carefully packed, theship is super fast and the mk has tried it, hoping the company will last."
"It's worth a lot of money, but I won't be able to pay for it until I get this afternoon."
"It's for the baby, it's very happy, it's low, it's for the bth, it's barely notice that it's late, it's beautiful, the number of batteries you don't know, it's worth buying."
S. S. is too slow to deliver. Almost a month late. 10 days late. sd long not knowing ntn. is researching
"The keyboard is good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good."
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.
It's a nice keyboard. It's very smooth. Okay.
"Quick delivery, sharpening. Okay, at this price, the quality is too good."
"I'm going to need this keyboard again because I don't need it anymore. I'm going to need it. I'm going to need it. Okay, I'm going to need it. I'm going to need it."
The keyboard is cute. The key is soft and sensitive. Receiver is a little hard to extract/sharp.
"It's a little hard to press at first because you don't know the key position yet, but then you type it very hard."
"I'm very pleased with the quality of the product, and it looks good at the price, and it's very nice to have an elephant table at home for your wife to use."
"The keyboard is smooth, the general view is beautiful, exactly the model, small, good"
"The keyboard is beautiful and convenient and small, buying you the one you love very much."
It's really nice. It's beautiful. But it's a little hard to clean up.
"It's good for now. It's good. It's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good."
"The tiki package is always nice, the keyboard looks nice, everybody, it's pretty good to use it, because the Mk doesn't have to do anything. It's important that girls buy it in general."
"The beautiful keyboard, good use, teenage girls love it!"
"Fast delivery time, good keyboard quality, it's pretty light to hold it, so it's really good to be on your laptop."
"Pretty keyboard, pretty comfortable typing, convenient to work, using batteries, not bluth..."
I'm perfectly satisfied with keyboard quality at this price range!
"Stinn, perfect for price."
"Fast delivery, pretty much. Let's see how long the battery will last, if that's all right."
It's good to feel it at first. It takes a long time to learn more.
Shop's giving me a web short.
"It's worth five stars for the service, make up the bugs immediately."
"smooth keyboard, nice design and turn-down design"
There's no switch for each crime. It's not okay.

Nice.

that's a nice little keyboard.
"Quick delivery, carefully packed."
Good.
Good.
Okay.
u
Goodddddddddd
"The keyboard is light but sure, the key is not loud, use it, connect it well, cost it, deliver Taki Now very quickly."
"Which money the keyboard needs is more powerful to press. The keypress is very clear. The character is printed in gray ink is very faint. And the peak is that after nearly a week of use, the U key is more likely to be paralyzed. The keyboard is not as sensitive as it was the first day."
"Advantage: Nice, cheap keyboard. Distinguishion: A slightly heavy click, a distance from the keys quite long and round. (Make large spaces between the keys, maybe one finger drop). Three factors add up to the state if you type 10 fingers, and after a while it will be very painful for your fingers."
"We need to change this product right away, the keyboard with the signs of being used, the package is extremely sketchy without boxes, the keyboard is paralyzed with a line of buttons from capslock to theenter button."
"The color is a little bit thicker than the image. Maybe because I don't know, the round key is a little bit hard to hit. It's a little sad because of missing keys like ***Up, *** Down, Home, End, Print Screen. It's a 3A battery instead of 2A."
The error product has been preserved.
"Wait a month and a half before you get anything, tiki's not a professional, if you don't make a request, you're probably not going to deliver it, you're not going to deliver it, you're going to be angry, you're going to be pretty, you should buy it, but you're going to buy it on a different platform."
Using the price well makes sense. I like the product using the battery because it's more sustainable than the charge. I don't know what it's like.
"The keyboard waits half a month, works slowly with the shop, rep, cskh of tiki, it's always busy, it can't cancel!"
"For the first time in my life, there's a two-month order experience, and I forget I've ever ordered a keyboard, and I don't know what kind of business Tiki is."
"There's no paralyzed button, there's no test so I don't know how long the battery's going to last, and the product's 250k, but its legs are distorted, like the long foot, which is going to leave the table on one side, so I'm going to have to use a pad to equal it. If the battery's going to last five months, I'm going to come back for four stars, but if the battery goes under a month, I'm going to go back but for one star."
"- Still collecting like yellow, without a notice or anything!"
"Tiki sold no bills, but no obvious conditions. This is the fourth time I've encountered a situation like this: no bills delivered, repeated reminders of Tiki's offer of 10 percent of what's been sold or repossessed. Either pushing the difficulty towards the buyers that Tiki can't afford, 10 percent of which is VAT tax (not payable), all of which is given in voucher, at the same time means that customers have to buy again, if they don't buy, if they don't buy money, if they're used instead, or they can't pay."
"The key is really boring, it's pretty boring, there's no rubber suck on the bottom, it's slippery on the table, there's no use in general."
Format: 10 There is no sign for a client to connect to the computer. Only using kn with the untested computer is not known as the battery device yet.
It's okay. <i>The sound doesn't sound so loud.</i> <i>The price is worth the trade.</i> <i>So it's not gonna take long.</i> <i>The store rep</i> <i>It's too long.</i> <i>It's too long.</i> <i>It's too long.</i> <i>It's too long.</i> <i>It's too long.</i> <i>It's too long.</i> <i>It's too long.</i>
"The space button, every time you press it, it's pushed down. It always has to type, and then it's up."
"I put the first day of August 22th yesterday, and I got it, and I didn't do anything about it."
The round keyboard isn't quite used yet.
"The keyboard bought, pleased with the quality, but I can't connect with the chip-sharp, the keyboard has the source switch. The shop guides me with it."
Buy the KJK but get the K610 code.
"In fact, there's a bit of a toy, which doesn't look what it would look like, but it's good, it's comfortable."
"I need a keyboard for the ipad that this keypad isn't, it can't be changed!"
"I bought a multi-scopic film table. I mean, it's a paper-pounder."
"Tiki delivers quickly during the day. With a light on it, it'll be better."
"Pretty good for the price, but there are two missing buttons looking good."
Keyboard on space will automatically delete the remaining characters. Too bad.
"It's the wrong color. I put yellow, but I get pink. The price of two colors is different."
"I've got the package, but I haven't been able to connect it to my laptop."
too beautiful. without the screen key. The shortcut to the screen scan could not be used either. Sorry.
The keyboard can only type a few words and cannot connect to the lasptop.
"It doesn't sound good, it's still loud, and the words on the keyboard aren't clear, but the overalls are fine."
"sp uses fine.YY shapes, good typing keyboard"
"Fast delivery, good keyboard."
"The keyboard is light. The quality is not high, but it's hard to ask for money."
The Shop can show you how to connect to the Macbook machine.
"There's no source button, web-head is hard to plug in, but the keyboard is pretty simple."
"Nice pattern, use okay, but sometimes the connection's off."
loose keys are too tight.
"The keyboard ok, each sin the round button is not familiar, the feeling is small"
A text key can be pressed but the shortcuts are not used
"The product's good, but I don't know how strong it is."
"For this price it's pretty good, the keyboard is pretty sensitive, it's easy to hit, it's easy to buy."
"It's got a key stuck on it, and it's got a bit of plastic on it."
I don't know what the quality is yet.
"It's got the eyes, it's got the eyes, it's got the batteries, it's got the eyes, it's got the eyes, it's light, it's got the batteries, it's got the batteries."
"a key failure, press one key to another."
"key error, press one word to another"
Get your money back!...
It's bad. Long-term delivery. Too bad.
Okay.
It's okay. It's good.
I'm not a friendly delivery officer.
"The rest of us, we'll use more."
The delivery's too long.
"Thank you, tiki."
No PRSCR button taken the screen
"It's nice, it's good money."
Synchronising folder
Good sate
It's just a quick keypad.
"It's not much, so it's a three-star deal."
Cheap...
"It's as beautiful as an ad, and it's about as tight as a full moon girl without a husband."
"I've never been disappointed in Tiki's speed, and I've put a shot in less than two hours of receiving, and my dad's likes it, he's nice, he's good, he's good, he's good, he's good, he's good, he's good, he's good, he's good, he's good, he's good, he's good, he's good, he's good, he's good, he's good, he's good, he's good, he's good, he's good, he's good, he's good, he's good, he's good, he's got cell phones."
It's just a little hard to press the buttons due to the characteristics of the phthalates.
"Fast delivery, nice form, good quality, elaborate detail, satisfied with the product."
"Close back gives a strong, non-smoking feeling. Press the source button and lower the volume you need to use a little force to eat but no problem for a 5-star shop."
"Time's up, time's up, time's up, time's up, time's up, quality's up."
"Nice, medium, non-smoking handle."
"Ip 13 Promax is big, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good."
It's a beautiful product.
"Beautiful product, ae playing handsome chicken"
"Apeldjus, sure and beautiful!"
Okay.
GICKDddddddd
It's nice. It's tight.
I'd love it for the 5th Shop.
Nice backs fit into the machine.
Buying a cheap satle.
Nice number just printed with sew
"It's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice."
"Nice Sp, as it turns out, is a great deal."
Good.
Okay.
Good.
Nice back.
Nice fit to sp
It's beautiful.
"She's pretty, she's good, but she's a little tight with the machine. Sometimes she's okay, and she's a long time on the machine, and she's okay, and she's a little hot, and every time she takes her toilet off, it's pretty heavy."
"I'm going to look for dark brown but no, I'm going to put this color on, but it's okay to look at it."
"Unloading iPhone 13 minis, receiving only watches, complete payment."
"It's too bad, it's too close to the phone, it's too big."
"The top and the left are tight, the bottom and right are slightly open."
It's a good quality. Some of them don't hold the engine's side yet.
It's nice and tight.
High Quality and Beautiful Quality
"It's nice, but it's been hard work trying to keep the skin from scratching people's insides."
"The quality's fine. If it's closer, it'll be perfect."
"I'm on the phone, I'm on the side."
Not satisfied with being unhappy.
"Okay, good use, good quality, good quality."
The top and bottom were exposed.
Useable. OK. Press keys are not good.
Good.
"The delivery is extremely fast, the package is secure, the package box is not distorted, the mouse is neat and very beautiful, the buttons are clear, sure, but I don't see the store stamp; I only see the vendor stamp."
"About the size and style of G102 identical to G102 but slightly heavier by using batteries AA and no RGB (of course, to save electricity because the template does not have a powerpiny pad to use the newly charged mouse pad) has a small minus point of software which is not blind the button to convert the high performance mode and save batteries, so when you play games, you have to go to the log-clicking software to edit"
"Fast delivery, light product clicks."
"The first one has to say that the design is quite good, but it's very light. The roll is very good. The next one is almost impossible to sense the delay. I'm going to let the FOI performance mode be used to use it. The new battery is high. The rat's weak is very loud (I know log has a silent technology) but I don't put this technology on many of the clicks and I'm afraid to play the mouse game."
"In fact, I don't really understand what the cable does, because the cable has only one end, and if it's used to install its head, it's not like it's attached directly to the machine."
"The mouse is small, the battery is heavy, so the mouse is significantly heavier, using a 3A + adatjee battery that reduces significant weight. The back cell is using tusks, so it doesn't cause any g603 to be held by g603. The small button and deep travel should take time to get to know it again."
"I didn't have enough money to invest in the higher-end mouse. But after consulting the review on G304, I decided to bring her back."
"It's a bit of a waste of time to wrap it up. 2nd, super quick delivery. 10 p.m. You can't even get up in the morning, it's about 8 o'clock before someone calls you down to pick it up."
"Not only for playing games, but also for doing office work or learning, but as you start to buy, you feel that rats are heavy, but gradually you will get used to them. The small mouse should be suitable for carrying them."
"It's a perfect fit for your hand (0.72 m), the feeling of holding in your hand, and not getting tired."
"Quick delivery, real product, good use."
"There's a small question in the box that says, ""The item without stamps on the mouse is based on the safety stamp on the box."" And so, if the log in the case of logs being entered into the VN, then it's sometimes due to the number that doesn't match the mouse series, it's normal."
"I bought two of them, for the office and for the pc at home: - Pins very long, I spent six hours a day; an A.A. uses six months in high performance mode (Mahz Polling Rating; 1ms along with the mouse) - the grip button is very good, it's sharp. Mouseing of logs has a favorite button right now - SIX is too good for work and catollinging and very efficient to save - the electricity - which allows both power and macro keys on both sides and DPI, which is very convenient for the job. - For example, you're going to use this value very little less than perfect."
"Holds fit. The sensitivity is good. Sees Gwib's receiving, so it's gotta be the main product. I don't see any warranty stamps. I don't know what's in there."
"The package is carefully packed, the price is reasonable, the transportation and delivery are fast."
"Very pleased, a wireless mouse at a very good price range, more than a lot of rats have wires other than a 1000-hz sample frequency and 1 meter response:)"
"buy it because logstone is a good brand, company's main product, birth is clear, good within the price range."
"It was given a battery, which for over a month still hasn't lost any batteries (I use it in normal mode). The mode is usually equal to the right mouse with the right wire, and I don't see the difference between the two regimes, and I personally prefer this mouse to the ones that have to charge, because the batteries run fast."
"It's a nice package, careful product, fullbox, whole set."
"Using g102 to move over this one feels exactly the same, but it's less attached to the weight, so it's pretty flat."
"I'm pretty good at the price, no problem at all, I hope it lasts a little bit."
"Touching, very handy, beautifulppp"
"Slight, sensitive, super fast delivery"
"Hold it steady, there are four molds to adjust mouse speed, fast, smooth feedback, and it's so good, it fits the money."
"A soft, sensitive mouse. This should be used with pad Mouse to enhance the dilithm when moving. Note that the USB cable is connected to the mouse, attach it to the mouse, and place it as close to the mouse value possible to avoid the lag at first, and that at first you don't use it, and then you can use it all."
Same thing as g102 without wires
Let's hope there's a lot of goods like this for the consumer's safe choice of online purchases.
That's a real clam.
"So buy this one, it's like G102 cutting the rope. Hope it's a sustainable click, because G102 is only double clicked for five."
"Good mouse, soft hands, high top."
"The whole set, the package is carefully packed, and the ACTtech is off the table."
"It's good to use a battery, it's not very much required, it's small, it's small, it's good to use it, it's good to use an AA battery, it's a little uncomfortable for individuals to change batteries, if it's good to use a battery."
"After more than two months of using this mouse, I'm very pleased with this mouse's mouse sensor. I can't even argue with the mouse sensor, I've got a handle. I've got a small hand (16 cmx8 cm), so when I've got a mouse that feels like a mouse that fits my hand. (I can also remove the pin cap of the mouse and use it.) And finally the GPROVPM software is used to adjust the mouse or other things, then I have to say that I'm very happy, I can make a lot of adjustments in my mouse."
Ten points for the delivery team and the product team.
"The Logotech mouse is a non-controversial quality. Click gently, click but it's not called loud, full solid plastic."
"Rats are good, quality, everything's great."
"The best wireless mouse in wireless mice, no lag, no battery failure, with an Alkaline Duracell battery. Check the online maintenance limits on ict.digiworld.com.v./tra-cu-han-spab.Bit timed 2 years after buying mice (2020)."
"The most popular mouse has ever been. <i>If you buy 1 MM1, now 990k is so beautiful.</i> <i>G400s hated the rope.</i> <i>Go to G602, it's good but it's big and it's hard.</i> <i>This is easy.</i> <i>She's like an office mouse, and she doesn't feel smoother and less comfortable.</i> <i>G602, 3 degrees.</i> <i>Let's just turn herself up once in the mouse.</i> <i>The battery from buying to h4-5 months,</i> <i>The game is good enough to use of the office.</i> <i>It's more comfortable.</i> <i>"
"Delay can be considered to be no, form and for both left-handed and right-hand people, suitable for all mouse grips, the battery time is fine, generally the best wireless line to play games at a scale of 1 fold"
"Rats are very soft, they're sensitive, they're bought at 799k, they're very happy. The profile program for mice is pretty good."
It's great. I don't know if it's sustainable.
"Rats are sensitive and smooth, hands-on."
"OKee but click a little bit, roll down the mouse for some heavy video game lines, it looks like the battery can't be charged."
"Light mouse, use ok, with pp's bh stamp"
"Good, neaseal. 1907 not to use more."
Fast deliver quality good as in the image does not disappoint
Chuot's over!
"It's been a long time, but it's still a little early than expected, the company's got a lot of heat, fps of coffee, each one that just bought 870K the next day down to 860K --"
"There's a degree of roughness, and the handle can feel it, even though there's already two mice, but there's one more today, because those two mice are as big as they are, and they don't feel as comfortable as they are."
"tiki delivers fast, in terms of quality to use time to view ntn"
They've never let us down. The battery hasn't failed us in a week. The control software hasn't lost a line.
"For more than a week, I'd say it's my hands that a battery that's been working on it hasn't run out yet. There's a PC app on Logotech's PC that has support on it."
"Rats are okay, but let me ask you, this rat doesn't have a laser light under it."
Satisfaction
"The tiki cave is packed well, the new canister, the fast delivery time is set for noon."
"Tiki delivers fast, well packed, not yet using a Volvotech mouse, so I don't know how much she likes to use it."
"Light, sensitive."
Standard delivery. Quick delivery.
"At this price, she's too high, she's got the right arm-to-hand sensors, she's got long-term battery rats, she's got the right click feeling."
"Got the right product, packed goods carefully, extremely pleased"
This is the very bright and feelless good in your hands.
The chromium fits your hand. The mouse's a little light. Who's the little hand that might like it. The price's pretty good.
There are all kinds of sensitivity adjustments right over the mouse.
"The company's main item, no errors have occurred during the use"
"Nice, light, sensitive?"
"The rat looks good, the whole set, but it doesn't see the warranty stamp, and it's a little heavy for the log that he's using."
"This mouse is for those of you who have small hands, so you need to keep an eye out before you buy it. The two sides are a little steep, so it's kind of hard to hold on to."
"The ability of the mouse to function is equal to that of a G502 mouse that I've been using for a while, and it's a much lighter weight, and it's no longer stuck with the mouse wire. It's very satisfying."
"Rats go to work, it makes sense."
Rats are good to be comfortable.
"The upgrade is worth G102, but the office's been used better because of its long-term battery."
"Mouse has time to respond well, not jerking off like other office mice. Small mouse, light weight, proper hand."
"The mouse is very neat, the GSM. The battery is very convenient above. The Dpi is very sensitive, can install five degrees, has the color light on the button to distinguish. It's worth the money."
One hundred and a point.
Quality's fine.
Hold a strong link with your hand
Mouse uses quite well but tries to install several times but the software still doesn't receive the mouse:((
There's nothing to talk about. Buying a discount at nearly 700k.
"LIVING fast delivery, stable connected mouse, hopefully not double-clicking like a G102 line."
It's genuine.
"The real mouse. Use it. Okay, but there's no warranty stamp on the mouse and the box, so what's this for?"
"Fast delivery, sp prime, good use, back prices after a while, thank you."
"Fast delivery, carefully packed. Mouse is good for use, no errors (used almost two months)"
"Despite the wireless but very well, at least the delay, the battery used for a very long time, I'm pleased with this product."
"The NFLtech G3-5-0 DPI 6 key-Point Service Mouse is very good, the battery is long-term, very valuable at the price."
It's very good.
"The package is well packed, the mouse is very smooth, very sensitive."
"Rats use very well, certainly hands, and degrees of delay are almost none."
"Fast delivery, mouse use very stable:)."
"Mouse is light and sensitive, and it doesn't feel like other wireless mice."
"I don't know if I'm here, but I'm happy right now."
"Mouse is fine, using it long enough to know whether the scroll bar or the left key has double clicks"
"Well, there's no problem, but there's no lights Ied to shine when it's dark."
It's good. It's a little slow with the mouse.
"Smeagol, light"
mouse is good
"Fast delivery, very good mouse at a price, it's a log company."
"It's okay, guys, but whatever you do, you hit review, it says log in, log in, you're free to go."
The product's very good.
Tiki delivers fast. Mouse can configure sensitivity for each individual's needs.
"In fact, it doesn't take that much sensitivity, but mice are tough, clicks are strong and design is nice, so buy it."
"After a month of use, there's nothing to complain about at 799K."
It's too fast to deliver the product. It'll take a while to find out.
"The product's very good for use, it's handy, I use a lot of Voltatech mice, but it's the best kind."
"In Vietnam, 304, in the United States, is 305, buying both of them exactly the same, just different numbers, but 304 in VN is much lower than buying 305 in the U.S."
Still in good hands.
"The socks are fine, so buy more batteries, you'll use more stability."
Good mouse.
"Rats are good, they're more than five rs outside, logos are as good as the first day."
Where can I buy it when I'm out of control? Where can I buy it?
900k. I don't know what the price of the drama you haven't used yet.

"Good product, quick delivery."
Good.

"Quick delivery, good mice, all kinds of CSGO games, PUBG"
"Fast delivery, smooth and convenient, plus a mouse moving table."
"Fine but light mouse, relatively fast movement"
It's okay because it's new. Wait a while.
They can't use a computer without it.
Good stuff.
"The main product, the good stuff, was given with a very smooth and smooth mouse pad."
The price is too good for a wireless mouse.
Good.
Have a good one.
"Take it, take it, take it, take it, take it, take it."
Good.

It's better for the office than the game.

Rats are pretty good.
"I'm pleased with the product, the good stuff."
"Nice pattern, quality, long-term batteries."
That's a good year to use.
Good.
"I thought after the ceremony, I'd get it before the ceremony."
"It's not a two-hour order, but it's still delivered very quickly, it's easy to use, it's not very battery-saving."
Fast deliver fits the description
The people should be comfortable.
Cool.
Good.
Quick Use
Rats are good.
"It's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good."
"It's extremely pleased with Tiki's way of packing, the box is beautiful, it's not twisted, the whole set."
You've been using it for a week and you've got nothing to say about it.
"Fast speedship with thiki ""lat"""
"Good, neat, sensitive."
The mouse uses two months. It's okay.
My friend's comment is that it's all because I'm on Anywhere 2S.
Good.
The product is as good as described!
"Sp, that's pretty good."
Good.
Great.
"Use it well, buy it while the flash satle is 700K is good."
Hhh
Pretty good.
Quick delivery.
Okay.
"It's worth 900k, it's great to have an Ied."
Okay.
"If the rat breaks, it'll buy the mouse."
"Play the game very much, the first game has been pentrells"
"Sensitive rats, delicious at a cost rate, quick delivery."
"Good quality, cheap price for students like me:"
Okay.
"I've been using it for about a month now, and it's a pretty good use for rats."
"Well, there's no doubt in general of Logotech's product."
"Good product, delicious and nice boxes, full of information, generally satisfied."
"Rats use so well that I just bought Jo. He lost his gate, and then he bought it back."
There's brands on the box and mice full.
"It's getting good, fast delivery, two weeks worth of batteries, it's not over at HI, good."
"Business, good use, quick delivery."
"Get the goods, get the real ones, use the mice to designn very well."
"Stability, sensitivity, delay, I'm very pleased."
"The delivery's fast, the quality's off the table, the handle's good."
"Main mouse, raw seal, very smooth."
The real tiki company rat makes the delivery on time.
"For me personally, G304 deserves to be an advanced wireless version of G102, which, if you need, is extremely good, but with extremely good Hero sensors for me, the delay is negligible. The GBMtech line is also software for correcting the speed sensors so if you need it, you can download them to their customization."
"The firm has been cut for branding the shop, but the new mouse, it's good for nothing, the quality it takes time."
"The mouse clicks very, very loud, but the mouse rolls between the fences, which is not the same, it's not the same thing, it's the same error, it's very hard mouse, it's worth the money (I hope it's going to last a long time)."
"It's a little bit bigger than the G Pro that has the strings that you're holding; the key that this one has is a little harder than the G Pro, but it's normally not complaining, it's fine, it's just waiting to see how long it's going to last; there's a pity that now this mouse has a discount compared to where we're going to buy it for a while."
"I just bought G304 on March 31, 2021, but I didn't have access to the MacBook that I didn't want to use, so I bought G590 to use."
"The mouse is so good, it saves the battery, and it fits the hand, but the mouse has a big weakness, and when it rolls, it's not so hard, it's not smooth, it's kind of loud, and it feels very vulnerable, and the truth that almost a year after it's used is stuck, and it's almost impossible to use."
"The mouse uses very well and kindly, the long-term battery, however, the constant use of it almost a year or so is often a mouse sticky error when clicking only once. This error occurred with both mice of this type. This error is a common error for the log mouse."
The initial experience was pretty bad because the mouse or the missing mouse was connected to software or the poor connection that led to the shock of the operation.
"Buying G603 is a little big and heavy, buying a Razer Ateris is a little small, and eventually buying a G304, and it's a little bit heavier than a model with a G102."
"Had to shut up dead, and said to tomorrow to make sure that the day's vacation day was set.* be vcl person. have to notice peopleship. the product is ok. the product is ok. must manage theship person."
"With good use, however, the lid that is attached to it is a bit difficult to be careful to unmount the legs (I almost had). It is best not to remove the lid on top of this mouse because it is not as sure as the mouse that has the lid on it below. The features are normal, which are therefore not sustainable."
"What do you mean, on November 23rd, when you bought a gift with tiki now, you got a rat with no gifts, but you're doing it?"
"The rats haven't been bought in six months, they've never seen anything so bad about Logotech, they don't know if the rats are out of date."
"The product's good for use. But I suspect this is a used product, a broken mouse edge, and the other pieces have been scratched a lot."
"My mouse got it from 23/03, and suddenly web's head picked up, so let me ask you if I can get it out of here or if I can buy it first from the store."
"The first time you use wireless mouse, which is the last time. Because graming needs stability when you play it, but this mouse keeps losing its signal for five to 10 minutes is one time, and it takes less than 50 centimeters from the mouse to the usb, and it's very uncomfortable to play games. Pin is very fast, because the mouse that's got gaming mode should last a month than the battery, and if you turn this feature off, it's going to last nine months, you're going to have to download the software, and it's complicated."
"The whole package has Digiword stamps, which is that when you don't have to deliver Tikinow fast for two hours, the delivery will be ready for a few days. Click a little bit bigger, click a little harder than G4 gigabyte. Easy, easy to use."
Do we want to secure sp?
"I feel like I have a gift with this order, but when I get it back, Tiki will check for me."
"It's been very good, it's been two months, but it hasn't left the battery in two months."
"Tiki asked me how I checked S/N the product on DigiWorld didn't see the warrants, and I didn't see the S/N on the mouse, and I didn't see it in the box."
"The mouse that buys three days has damaged the left mouse click, and after sending the warranty for another half day, it's time-deprived, and it's completely frustrated about the quality."
"Mouse cannot connect with head receiver Unifying. Mouse is thin, light, material is not equal to price."
"The package box is tight and beautiful as time delivers fast, the mouse receives a form that looks new, so does the box shell, but there is something in the mouse and on the box shell that doesn't match. the digi stamp is also stilt. Would tiki please respond to the cause?"
Why is the warranty form a stamp that you don't see on your mouse body?
"The mouse buys 20 days, but it's already done by the doulick. It's not constant."
"I set it up on November 10th, November 14th, which is almost the end of November 14th, and my order hasn't been taken care of yet."
The feeling of left mouse being held. I don't know if it's the push of the hand too fast or because of the design of the product.
"It's good quality, but I don't know if it's the same product or the fact that you can use it for a while, you're gonna have to press it a dozen times to get it back to normal."
I've been using double clicks for over a year.
The left mouse has been paralyzed at no time. Texting support for tiki has not received any reply.
"This product can bring it itself, can't it pass Tiki, because recently it's not really good for the press, it's been a long time for the user to wait."
"When I get this, the box cover is in a state where I've broken the seal and then I've got tape on it, and I've got dust on the inside of the mouse, and I've got a G102 on my hand, and I've got a little bit of a mouse, and I'm used to it for a while."
"Used for a year, left mouse like double click was paralyzed."
used a week mouse failed
"It's normal not to see any dominant functions, four dpi levels that are still unsatisfying."
"The mouse bought it for two weeks, double-clicked it, bought it, got it wrong, called Tiki, promised to respond for 24 hours, but didn't see anything."
It's pretty fast delivery. A biz mouse with a finger index is a little bit of a varmint pad.
"The good mouse is fine, but sometimes it turns out to be double."
"The mouse shell material is quite comfortable, the mouse is a bit too light to play games. The log sticker brand in the hand is also very trusting."
"In a few months, double-clicked. 800k flying."
Or failure to lose left key due to design error (resisted at temporary)
"The one with the long fingers, like the Guita or the piano, and the hands that fixe the ambassadors, will be tired."
"Using a year of broken left key, the new store for another mouse is good!"
"When the mouse is clicked for a period of time, how does the mouse contact the warranty?"
"Design and quality is good, but it's just too bad there's no Bluetooth to use with laptops like Dell Xps or MacBook Pro."
"Web's missing head product, so we can't use it."
"sp is good, but I don't know why we're spending a lot of time sweating our hands."
"Look at the office, it's simple, it's smooth."
"Once a week, the right mouse is in very few use, quite disappointed, I don't know how the warranty works."
"Okay, the design isn't beautiful, it's not possible to use fast, it's kind of slippery, it's light, it's handsy."
"I bought it for two days, I used it or I got it in exchange for the warranty, didn't I?"
It is nice enough for everyone it's Logotech.
It's your shipper delivery at the time of the rain.
"Use it well, but it's a little small."
"Design versus feeling close to G102 but feeling the coating plus the cheap material, unfortunately there's no other Ied. OK."
"The mouse handle likes the hand very much, but it's very annoying to be stuck with interference."
"It's okay, it's okay, it's okay."
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.
"Rats are fine, but there's been a problem."
Supplies are fine.
"Ms buys us a good shot, Mom."
I can't push the click...
That's a very good log line.
"It's kind of a scratch, it's okay, it's a good deal, so it's okay with the product."
"The key's fine, the battery's good when the battery's charged."
Tiki's too slow to deliver this one. It's normal to buy one day. This one waits almost a week.
"I'm not sensitive, I have to go through it all the time, so I'm tired of it."
"It's not the same as the appointment, but it's already packed before our three-and-a-half-day schedule."
The package is intact.
"Fast delivery, very good product quality, very pleased."
"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

The scroll button is very loud:D This is a feature or an error.

"It's very high quality, very fast and steady."
"The 65-watt charge is exactly the way it's described, and the fast-loading is given with a type-c charge cable, which is very kind of cool."
It's a bit slow.
"Speed up the laptop, okay?"
It's good. It's good.
Okay.
New use was quite pleased; however the lights Ied showed no light when plugging
Quick pin but this charge type c failed to be used

It's okay with the price.
Okay.
"After three days of use, the plugs are broken, and now there's a wire or not, can I get my product back?"
"Bad payment support, no enthusiasm."
"The hard wire, 2 meters long, is too comfortable when your screen is far away, fast data transmission, sharp video quality, reasonable prices, quick delivery, there's a need to continue supporting the shop."
A super fast delivery in less than 12 hours has been delivered despite the other provinces.
I'm using it to transmit video and audio from my laptop to television.
I don't have any photos.
"It's a lot better than the standard HDI we're using, worth the money."
The cable goes up to 75 hoursz for the trick you're using.
"It's thick, it's perfect."
"The quality package, the package carefully, will support the number again."
Good.
Sp good
Good stuff.

Good stuff.
Okay.
Quick delivery.
Great product.
Very good.
Okay.
Quick delivery.
"Good package delivery doesn't get the quality to use the time to figure out how long after two days it's still not connected, and the wire is broken, so you think about it before you buy it."
The connection's loose.
I can use it.
It's just the part where you push the button a little hard.
"The plastics, the hugs, the right ones, the good ones, the fast ones."
"The seams are very beautiful. Fearless later on, the photograph is sharp. Dái, sure, will support next time special delivery very quickly."

"Pad's pretty thick and soft, and it's pretty nice."
"Nice, clean, smooth underwear."
"Very well, the print is pretty good, just regret that there aren't more pictures to choose from."
"It's really terrific for you, 90 by 40, and it's so sharp, it's so thick, it's so thick, it's so big."
"I ordered two days and I got the good stuff, but I sure as hell had to wash it to use it because it smells pretty good."
"I haven't used it yet, but I've seen the order in a few days. I feel it's kind of soft."

I bought it well for a good price.

Quick delivery. It's a thick sheet. It's a pretty solid patch. 90k is too much of a deal.
"It's soft, it's just good luck, it's smell, but it's not something I care about, it's full."
It's beautiful. It's better than skin.
"Great, thanks to all this I don't need to remember the shortcut anymore."
"Something like shape, quality, quick delivery."
It's okay. It's okay.
"Pad's big, he's thin, he's clean, he's worth his money, he's only making poly plastic smell a little uncomfortable, I don't know how long it takes to stop the smell:"
Thanks for the shop.
"Good product, carefully packed Shop, time for quick delivery."
"Good product, carefully packed Shop, time for quick delivery."
"Pad's the best in the picture, very pleased."
"Although the color is slightly darker on the image, the product's okay, the duability is time to decide."
"The good stuff is good material, no unpleasant smell like any other product, the package is well delivered."
"It's good for the price of money, super fast for the delivery, so the soap doesn't smell very good for the print."
It's a good product.
"Got the package. It's big, it's nice."

Pad was beautiful and pretty thick.
Good.
"Good quality product, carefully packed, Tiki delivers fast."
Good stuff.
"The product's oke, but it's new so it smells a little bit of plastic, and anyone who's upset with the smell of plastic is out there so that it's a little less scented."
It's a beautiful product and excellent print!
"I can use it, but it's tough or not. It's time, it's a good head impression."
"Pad's fine, good quality, no bad smell of rubber, good delivery."
"The good stuff, the rubber smells a little new."

It's not good for the store to answer for a long time.
"The thick pad, the good quality, the price makes sense."
"Nice underwear, but not exactly what the shop owner said. Less than 100 inches [90 cm] wide, it's only 30 inches [35 cm] wide."
"It's the right picture, but the print's dimmed."
The product's okay.
"The carpet is big, smooth and beautiful."
"Soft, nice, generous, quick delivery"
"Fast delivery. The print quality is good, but the bottom lining is pretty slippery."
"Good print, thick material, good stuff like this."
"It's a big, nice, quick delivery."
Okay.
"Big mouse Lot, easy use and good looks, good for the price of money."
"Told you, the mouse moves are smooth. Nice print color."
This is not a very nice picture.
I'm in a bad mood.
It's amazing. Ten times like a great shop. A thousand points.
"Big shorts, quick delivery."
Nice goods.
It's a good one.
"Okay, but don't like the name of the site on the pad mouse."
"It's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's cheap, it's cheap."
It's beautiful; it's good; it's good; it's good to buy.
"Nice, soft, on the table?"
"Lot used it well, it smells kind of plastic, but it doesn't last a few days."
"It's a little thin, but it's a good print."
Lot of rats are good.
It's perfect.
"The delivery's over a week, but the material's so good, it's still five stars."

"The place is packed carefully, and it's thick, but it's new, so there's still a slightly uncomfortable rubber smell, detailing the print on the embellishment, which isn't sharp, but it's appropriate for 90K."
"The Shop delivers fast, but it's important to still be the product, the stink of cloth, how long it takes, to get some ink or something on top of it, so it's kind of annoying."
"I've been doing it for a long time, good speed, exactly the same size as I described it."
"Texting to the shop is not responding, tiki is more than a month from now, whether it's shipping with GHP, but on the side they're faster than they're recommending that mn not buy on tiki during the KAI epidemic."
"The quality is okay, but I've got three pieces I've got delivered, waiting for the response of the shop, minus one for the error."
"It's so big that I can't take a picture, it's so clear, I can read all the text in the comic book, I can just buy it and it smells a little uncomfortable for a few days."
"I bought two sps, and I looked at the same sample that we had when we first used paint, but it's about two or two days, and it's a little thin, but it's okay with this amount of money."
"You didn't get it. You sent something, tiki. Are you crazy?"
It has low sensitivity. Mouse is sometimes unable to touch.
"What do you mean by the black yellow Navy sample at book deal, but the black one?"
The colour is not as sharp as the image.
"It's not very nice, it needs to improve the quality of fabric and print."
I don't have exactly the same color as MoMA Rog.
"It's pretty good, but it's not nice, but I think..."
It's the wrong delivery store. It's boring.
"Fast delivery, suitable prices. 40x90 is wide open. Nice fabric."
"The product is exactly what it's supposed to be. The goods, the goods, the goods, the goods, the goods, the right ones, the right ones, the right ones, the right ones, the right ones, the right ones, the right ones, the right ones, the right ones, the right ones, the right ones, the right ones."
I thought it was a nice circle.
"The product's good, the sample's good."
"Give me the cave, but the pessimism runs out of content."
"There's a bump, there's something wrong with it."
It's a perfect price for the heavy price of rubber. The rest of it's cool.
Suddenly the colors aren't bright and fresh.
"It's a bit smooth, but it's good! good credit, it's very sustainable."
Saigon's still not out of shape because of the rush.
"Fast delivery, quality good."
"Bad print quality, quick delivery."
"It's a bit of plastic at first, but it'll be over in a few days."
"Thank you, shop."
"Good, good, good, right for the price."
"All right, let's pack up. Okay, but the package's in a hurry."

It's okay. It's okay.

"It's a little bigger, okay?"
"It's not pretty, it's thin,"
The delivery has all the footprints...
Okay.
"Good product, quick delivery."

Good.
The film that protected the S8 blamer screen has been broken and has arrived either by sending in new or by requesting a resupply.
"The product is in shape, in color, in goods, in goods, in goods."
It's just black. It's not my favorite color.
"OK the nice stuff like the picture, the nice package, the web HDI plug all get good."
"Nice, tough, quality."
Good. Nice.
"Let's check your message, but you bought it without stopping."
"minus point: - The noise-based key has already done nothing but generates a limb-click point. This is the MHP - the break-out connection has no place to be lost, if it's on the keyboard, it's so good. (or there's a place I haven't found a keyboard battery) - the mouse battery and the mouse battery is two different kinds of things. - The exchange is 14 hours on December 13th, and it's scheduled to be delivered on December 17th, see the date is to cancel out once again. (And the date I don't get a single read again)"
I've been using it for a month.
Hand over the package quickly.
Fine price
That's great.
Sp ok
"Two V's, B's not working."
"Getting an open order only paper, paper, and paper, not once, but always, really."
"It's been a long time since I've seen this girl, my friends are feeling good, so I'm going to introduce it. I'm going to buy it right now, so the price's pretty soft -- the product looks solid, the data is fast, the wire is 2 meters long, so it's very convenient, so..."
"Quick delivery, nice codes, I'm sure it's cable to the end of the network."
"The wire is a little thicker and stiffer than the phone wire, but it's thinner than the wire of a super fast water tank."
"The delivery was on schedule, delivered the right product."
"Pretty sure, you can't get it open, but it's really cool to look outside and shut up."
Package received.
Very fast delivery.
"Pretty good use, quality."
Nice wire. Good work.

Good.
Good. No noise.
It's delicious.
Good Use
That's good.
"In front of the big wire and so on, compared to the sp I used to buy, and the quality I didn't know."
The handwriting's not exactly the same as it was written.
The wire isn't very soft.
"Fast delivery, fit the clock in the wire."
"Quality ok, match Mi Band 4"
It's a tight wire.
It's not very good plastic quality.
Bad delivery. Bad delivery.
"The wire, attached to the curved frame."
"The wire's a little bent, it's fine, it's four stars."
It's a very good use.
It's great. It's cheap.
"Okay fit, utility."
"Beautiful product, sure."
Nice.
I'm having a hard time not checking the order.
The product's not convenient because it's too fast to stand.
"Buy the red green, really."
"Fine at the price, nice package."
"Quality, quick delivery. Five stars."
"Fast delivery, the product's more satisfying than the price."
Goods are at a price range.
Good.
"It's thin, it's irregular, it's light holes and speakers with cut marks, but it doesn't come in or out."
It's pretty cool.
"It's so beautiful, it's so beautiful, it's so beautiful, it's so beautiful, it's so beautiful, it's so beautiful, it's so beautiful, it's so beautiful, it's so firm, it's so firm, it's so firm, it's so beautiful, it's so beautiful, it's so beautiful."
"Well, sure, it's a little slippery."
"It's good, it's been days."
Good Use
There's only two lines on the line when the power runs out.
"Small, sure."
"It's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good."
"Light, easy fold to put in the backpack. Help changes height and angle using laptop. For machine 14 inches I feel very sure. There are no 15.6 inches to test it."
"It's Chinese, but it's solid."
"Okay, okay. Good price."
"It's so good, it's a bag of cloth, it's great. It's not even a big book, it's not a big book."
"The product gets sure, the silver design is fancy."
"Be careful with the package, the rack is secure."
Sure.

"It's a liquid side, but it's pretty good. It's within the price range."
"It's a terrible design, but the useless government isn't helping."
I don't know.
What's wrong with the snails when they're taken out?
The product is solid. Hold tight.
Sp is quite willing.
"Got the pieces, confirmed good, all the accessories so anyone could paste it on their own."
"It's brand new, it's beautiful, it's nice, it's fast delivery shop."
"The kit is full, it's full, it's full, it's glass-viewed, it's because of the delivery, it's still going to support the shop."
Okay.
"Good, sure."
"We've bought this product many times, so we don't have to talk about sustainability."
"Hi shop, I bought this order on March 4th asking for a red bill, but I haven't seen it yet."
Okay.
The iphone is more convenient.
The price is reasonable.
"The product gets the right description, the right quality, the right price, the warm counsel shop, the fast delivery, will support the shop!"
"Tiki delivers quickly, the product is fine and hard, but with iphone 13 prox, there's got to be more damage to the leg or else it's going to fall down."
I'm sure you'd like it very much.
"It's a pleasure, the product's happy. It's going to support the shop."
Okay.
"Package well, not used"
That's exactly what I'm talking about.
"The lights don't come up, the products are cheap plastic, and more than that, texting them without complaining, and putting on the phone, they turn on the spring, they're 341K, but they're not going to make it, and they're very sad."
"Good work, no problem."
"Couldn't make it with Logotech's keyboards and mice, paying more than 14 days without response."
Put the red one on the green one.
"This product is a ghost, carefully packed product, which will support the shop next time it's alive and the money is left after the plague."
"It's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's fast."

Good Use

It's a beautiful sound image.
Okay.

Quality Cables
Great!
"The material isn't very soft, it's hard and it's rough on the edge of the key, it's really hard to press."
"It's okay, it's good to see a lot of prints, but it's okay to use it on pencil."
"It's thin, it's good writing."
"There's not one layer down here, but it's not too hard to paste."
It's quality and it's worth it.
"You can't get a microphone, you can't use it, you can't get a hold of it, you can't use the attached piece, you can't use it, you can't use it, you can't use it, you can't use it, you can't use it."
"After using it, you can see the product is solid, you can see the ear button."
Type That's good.
That's great.
The key to being sensitive at press is slow is x2; the other one's quite OK.
"Slow lacquer = Fast heat = Machine heater where there's a fast charge: LPL, LEO (Magsafe, Type C, Fast C)"
"It's not as fast as you'd like, but it's stuck to a bump, so it's easy to use, and it's hard to turn into a wen."
I don't know what it'll be like.
"It's just for the iphone line, it's a pretty good connection distance, you can charge it to an ibuprofen."
"It's hot, so 20 to 80 percent charge, iphone 13 automatically stop charging because it's too hot, I don't know if it's Case, but it's a quick charge, battery capacity is fine."
"After two weeks of use, quick charge, but it's easy to heat, but it's nice and neat."
"Nice design, it's a little hot at the moment, it'll take a long time to find out how long it takes."
"The product is quality, the envelope is full of life, the face of the battery looks good, it looks pretty solid, it's neat, it's easy to use for 10 points shop."
Cannot initialise Evolution's mail component.
"It's good, it's small, it's been a while, it's good quality."
Copy that.
"It's not gonna fall, it's gonna hit fast but it's gonna be hot."
"The delivery is on schedule, it's well packed, but the charge is pretty slow."
"The store is packed thoroughly, the pile is in full shock."
It's up to 80 percent easy to heat. The protein automatically stops charging until it's bth.
"It's good, but it's a little low."
"It's okay. It's pretty quick. It's always good to use thick, thick, and it's charged with bthg. It's not good to breathe, it's not good to breathe."
Good.
I've bought them a lot of times.
"It's beautiful, it's small, it's quick delivery."
"Lightness, colour unlike image"
Used over. The ice cream product is slower than the parameters written on the ad.
"Hurry up, use it. Okay."
We need to get back in touch. We're hot even if we're using a wire.
I think it's just an iphone12 combination.
Batteries are as good as product ads.
It's a very good product.
Okay.
Not used
"I bought it to take a trip outside, but I can't figure out how long it took to charge without charge, and I charged it to 10 percent when I charged it, so I went to jail at 29/9-9, and my face in Vn, and it took me a long time to return it, and I asked for the supply to take care of it."
"While the charge is quite hot, the charge field only has one type C port, the accompanying cord is USB to type C, which is only used to charge the charge, not to charge the phone, it's pretty uncomfortable. If the manufacturer gives type C to type C, it's much better if the producer gives it a type C to type C."
"It's been a long time, but it's full and the phone's dead once in a while."
"Add point: quick, small charge, both wireless charge and rope. minus: magnets aren't so strong, they're easy to breathe."
"It's neat, it's nice, it's only taken a few days, it doesn't measure its strength, it's more time, it's fast, it's hot and it's gone."
"Three months of use has been inflated, and three months of less use."
"It's slow, it's heating up the engine."
The phone is hard to charge when it's using wireless charge. The number of batteries is poor. Only 80 percent can't charge the extra charge (even though it's fully loaded).
"The amount of record 10,000 metersAh that only charges once per cell phone is off the spare battery."
"It's hot, it's size and it's rough, it's not impressive."
"Good product, quick delivery, time to find out."
"Quick delivery, just as fast as a cable charge is, by magnetically slow, hit exactly once for an iPhone 13 cell phone, the battery's dead."
"It's got a battery charge, but the percentage of the batteries on the iPhone don't go up."
Slow contact.
"It's small but it's very hot, so life is less sustainable."
It's hot and it's hot.
"It's pretty slow, it's fast, it's hot, it's pretty neat, so okay."
"It's okay, it's good, but it's too thick for the description, it's too hard to get into the pocket."
"It's a little slow, it's a little hot."
It's not like it's supposed to.
"Use the battery, charge it."
"The product's hot, wirelessly charged."
"It's bad, it's slow, it's slow, it's expensive, it's bought, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone."
The magnets aren't sure.
"Smooth, smooth"
Nothing special but writing back.
The package is good.
Good product.
"Thank the suppliers, the producers, the producers, the suppliers, thank the vendors, thank the vendors, thank the electronics floor, thank the carriers so that I can use this kind of good product. <i>Thank you.</i> <i>Thank you.</i> <i>Thank you.</i> <i>Thank you.</i> <i>Thank you.</i> <i>Thank you.</i> <i>Thank you.</i> <i>The package is so beautiful.</i>"
A very good salesman who has bought twice feels good for the five stars.
Good product.

"The camera cover is loose, it's vulnerable, but I think it's better to take it off."
"Well, there's definitely a pretty good camera cover."
It's beautiful. It's like a very smooth grip. It's like advertising.
"It's very soft, it's a good shocker, it's got a hand held."
IP11p size but fake IP12z
It's a perfect fit.

"Same thing 100 percent, nice package, fancy look, an orange slide with a place on it that doesn't slip back and forth like any other base. Okay, everybody."
Okay.
Thanks to the shop.
Nice balls.
The quality is just as good as advertised.
Thank you for the product store.

"It's beautiful, but it's so simple."
You're so full of it.
Okay.
"Good good good good good good, fast move, price good. Okay, we're fucking durability in the process."

"The slide is too thin, the slide is secure, and at this price it's not satisfied, it's required to return the package."
"I can't hold it close, I can't get it off, I can't get it off, I can't get it out of my new 71K store, I'm so disappointed."
"It's normal. It's got a hard back, and it's got cameras on it."
"It's a little loose for the phone, it's fine, it's high for the product."
"It's either separated, or it's not. Buying an orange cap to protect it, and then fall off."
"Nice, sure, fit to the machine."
The quality of the product is very low.
"Nice, sure, the buttons are blended, sustainable or not going to have to be used for a while to find out."
Error product ( camera lid)
"It's a fake plastic, and it says the skin is too expensive, and the scissors are open, and they're falling, and it's not what they're expecting."
I'm not sure. I don't fit in with the phone.
"The camera guard's okay, but not close to the edge of the machine."
"Tweener, it's a little bigger than the F.B.I. twice."
I don't know if I've been on the phone for so long I don't know if I can get off the heat.
It's okay.
I'm fine.
"That's good, but it's a little tight, but it's hard to get out."
"The product's fine, the drag in the back isn't sure. Sometimes it falls out."
"Hardness, however, is a little loose, easy to fall out of."
The price is higher than the other store.
It's a bit rough.
The usual Sp isn't as pretty as the ad.
The quality doesn't match the price.
"No hugs, no slides, no certainty."
It's for sale. It's for sale.
Good stuff.
Fine.
Good.
Okay.
"() Rating doesn't count the point of your back, handing over what?"
"The quality of sound sounds is fine, sounds are very good, should be bought"
"The sound is sweet, the noise isn't too much."
That's a great sound.
It's a non-intrusion point that damages the ring at the end of the day. It's a long earache.
"Listen to the music too small, one right ear not into the bin"
"• HubFint is very sensitive, aluminum shell is strong and small. • The product uses very fine, stable, connected many devices at the same time without any failure, Hub is cool. • The speed of passing data is fast. The shell is very strong...."

The product is exactly the description.
"You get the product exactly like the quality store, and you spend three days running out of blue batteries, and you'll be full next time you'll support the shop."
"Buy two for the two of you who have a mail store that's missing, but you've managed to fix yourself a very good mood not to sell it, so it's worth 4G's worth of money, so the video is also very well located."
"Ordered at 18 o'clock, picked up at 19 o'clock, shop HD created the group over very professionally, gave it to me this morning, the management functions on app were pretty good, easy to use, sustainable or not, but the store was very reliable."
"Batteries have been used, but if they have been called around 1.5 days, the clock calls typed. The list is 15 people."
"I'm sorry, but theships don't give the ktra, they called and the shop called to see if they said the tiki law didn't work, and the store said to take care of the store, but it was a bit of a worry at first, but it was about unloading and putting together a lot of rest, and it was a nice watch, and it was like having a camera, and it was like, thanks to the shop that was so supportive."
"The fast delivery store has been in use for some time before assessing the time clock using long-term battery quality, fast support shop. Next time, you'll be buying again."
"The shop's very thoughtful, it's committed, it's very quick, it's good."
"One of the two cars I bought was the best. This one's the best. I'm so fond of him. He's running away, so he doesn't have any pictures, sory shop."

"OK sp is exactly what the ad was, and the oil experience is sp, so it's a little stuck, it's a nice support shop."
"The professional shop's got the wrong shop color changed very quickly, the brand-new shop quality clock for thousands of stars."
"The battery is temporarily healthy. If it's good, it'll buy more white. Thank you very much for your support."

I just don't like this positioning camera.
"Nice, located, so it's safe to use them for you, and you should buy them for your own safety."
"Loud speakers, quality video play, guest support workers very fast. Celebrity store should buy it."
We've been using a tg to see bin sd for three days. Good location.

"Get the goods right to the description, pretty ones, pack them up carefully."
I'll make sure that even though I'm buying NWW for regular delivery.
"All right, the new viettel is better off using the Oke."

Good product.
"Good sound, fashion, mic. <i>The ear button will be in your ear.</i> <i>So loud noise, but it's easy to sweat.</i> <i>So you remember to use your ears and ears.</i> <i>The wire is a little thin, which is, in general, at this price, and it's okay.</i> <i>May the producer handle the ear wire a little bit thicker and worse.</i> <i>Thank you for this product.</i> <i>Thank you for doing it.</i> <i>It's okay.</i>"
Good.
"The original charge port was type C, just like any other one. <i>The first charge port was the Lightning Gate.</i> <i>You should read the instructions carefully before you use them.</i>"
It's the right color and it's smooth.
"Fast pour, beautiful design, weak wireless charge"
The keyboard is much more likely than the one I always use.
Use it.
Em
"The average price's steady, the loud speaker's against noise, the quick delivery, the battery's 20 hours away from the male to the U.S. with just a handache. The battery's still there. That's good."
"It's so beautiful, it's so sound and it's so stable."
"It's beautiful style, it's good music, but loud resistance doesn't work."
"Sound's pretty good, noise filtering's okay. It's a bit disappointed. shipper's deliberately canceling non-invigorating delivery."
Listen to the music. It's very sweet. It doesn't hurt. It's okay.
The package is well packed.
It's okay. It's a touch to the left. It's open as much as it sounds.
The ear's fine.
Good.
Okay.
God
"As for packing, it's pretty good to just get a little bit of the box, but the sound part is generally the ones that get the price right, and so on."
"The quality's not perfect, the glue's out just now."
It's a little rough.
I can't use it for a week.
It's a palace. Okay.
"It's okay. It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay."
The image is very sharp.
"Webcam A4tech 720p HD PK-910P good use, image OK"
Satisfy with the price of money.
Quality ok
It's all right.
"The webcam looks pretty clear, the integrated microphones are against noise, the durability waits for time; just seeing the delivery bill out and the delivery is not coming out; email sent, Tiki says there's a seven-tenth day wait, but you don't see a half-month wait, you have to call the operator, it's a real problem for customers, it's a cost to call the operator, and it's a lot of time."
"Use temporary, dark, slightly ugly images. You need to turn on the pjonhf lights."
Image quality ok at a price range. No mic.
It's a quick delivery. It's exactly the size of a 140 watt 5.
"We got a quick, good charge at the price range."
"Dear user, please find the Daily Stock Report of HCM as thettachment."
Anker's main good.
That's great.
"Okay, so each rubber band comes with a bad quality, a bad grip, and it's hard to clean."
It's like advertising.
"It's an image-like product, a hug, a quick delivery."
"Sang, it's nice, it's nice, it's good, it's good, it's nice, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's"
"Nice shot, quality okay."
"It's really nice. It's really nice. It's got nice skin. It's not tight, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's not tight, it's not tight, it's not tight, it's fine."
"I love this color, it's classy, it's elegant, it's really cool, it's really nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's for shop five."
Good.
"The second time I bought it at the shop, the last time I bought it was a great deal, this second one, great quality."
"Wait, hold your hand, I've ordered it many times, and I've never been disappointed."
I'm sure it's beautiful.
It's a good idea.
"Nice balls, hands in hand, quick counseling."
Good.
Okay.
Okay.

"Bastard, you shouldn't have bought it. It's a waste of money."
Not leather like a commercial description.
"The product doesn't look like the shape, the camera border doesn't have the skin in it. The delivery guy's got a bad attitude."
I can't use it if I want to switch the other one.
Good stuff fits the machine!
Good.
"Thank you for your support at the store, quickly installed, carefully packed. You can note that this sample has no text, you can locate it, so if you want to have enough of these features, you can buy your life higher than this company."
It's an easy place to set up.
"I bought you a birthday present, lucky to deliver it on your son's birthday, if he's late for his birthday, he's not happy, he's not happy at all."
"Sze is a little too big for his baby's hands, use it well. <i>The memory card can hear almost 100 songs.</i> <i>So let's say it's okay.</i> <i>The next time you're going to continue to support it.</i> <i>We're going to be able to do it.</i> <i>We're going to be able to do it again.</i> <i>We're going to be able to hear almost 100 songs.</i> <i>We're going to be able to hear it.</i> <i>"
"The game was simple enough to be interesting to you, your mother first tried to call, and it wasn't hard, but it didn't work properly, she had to call you, she had to call you, she had to call you, she had to talk to you, this was the first time she bought tikid, this was the first time, it was easy to use."
"There's no need for a four-hour sim at all, and sim usually uses OK, quick, pick-up after two hours, give her a birthday gift, a good package store, professionally, and I'll show you this shop!"
"Beautiful model, 500 batteries, which are used for a long time, easy to use, no complicated installation, I've texted the shop through ***, I've been trying to buy two more and hopefully a discount store."
"It's pretty fast, it's packed carefully, it's good touch production, it's loud, it's soft, she likes it, there's no remote lock."
"It's a nice watch, quality as a description. Five-star shop."
"It's very convenient to use any sim. It's okay to use any sim, but it doesn't sound so good, but it's good to get him to speak English, too. Thanks for the shop."
"I've just got the package. Fast delivery, carefully packed to install what I'm responding to. This store is very sdt for counseling. Thank you, shop!"
It's a watch. Okay. It's a compound price.
"Great product, quick delivery."
Pretty SP like the description.
"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
Okay sp is pretty good
"The product doesn't work with Sluggettel, the quick delivery is carefully packed."
"Pleased, quick delivery, carefully packed, nice just yesterday, announced to you by week's notice that you received today."
It's a great watch. You should buy it.
Good.
Okay.
It's a cute watch. It's easy to assemble the baby. It's a good sound call.
"The box is a gift box, so it's easy to give."
Good use material mixes money.
"The clock hears a lot of games that little kids like very much, and they don't use four Gs very handy."
Very convenient to use your directly installed machine easily sim viettel can still use
"Good package, penny-received image"
"Nice watch, just sim heard of it."
"Quick delivery, new 5-p battery releases, sensors. OK, style. Okay, that's gone through the functions, and that's okay. It's worth it as a gift."
"The clock is not connected, the sim is installed, but the Shop is not supported."
"The quality, the tiki box is a little rusty. No problem."
Good quality watch with a good package. Kids love it when they do it on their own for five stars.
"Good quality, easy use, I'm very pleased, male black."
"Sp packs nice, and when it comes to quality it's gonna have to wait until you know for sure."
It's okay. It's okay.
"The package is good, sealed, properly described modeled, tried and found this product very good, stable, reasonable."
"Fine quality, nice color."
CENTRAL REFECTIONS LIKE THAT
Install a lot of games easy. Very much.
"I'm very pleased with the product, loud and clear, easy to use, the price is too good for such a good product."
Wants to change the product to another store.
Good use. Homeboy likes it. It's okay to wear it.
"Quick delivery, carefully package, that's a brand."
"Good quality, easy to use, no need to register anything, is well worth buying for your birthday."
"The good price, the good quality, the good delivery, the easy delivery, the easy to install, the use of sim, doesn't usually have to be 3g."
Okay.
"Good quality, good looking shop"
"There's plenty of entertainment, there's not much installation."
I've been using it for three months. Okay. Listen to me clearly.
Copy that. Quick delivery.
"It's beautiful, it's funny."
Quick delivery. He loves it.
"The second buy, the watch doesn't have to load app."
Sp is exactly the commercial.
Satisfaction
"I don't know yet, but I'm also in favor of the 5th floor store."
It's nice to have a accent.
"Buy two very good cars. One of them. One of them, one of them, and one of them will back us up."
"Buy two very good cars. One of them. One of them, one of them, and one of them will back us up."
The product's a bit like a description.
Nice new phone.
Fine quality
"Okay, price range."
"Good. No sim attached, so we don't know how to connect yet."
Good stuff.
There's plenty of games to play when it's boring.
It's as beautiful as it looks.
good quality and cheap quality
It's amazing.
Id ff 171017357
Easy to use
"Easy to use, your favorite baby."
Nice watch.
Please.
Okay.
Very High Quality
It's cheaper than Tks and tikis.
Okay.
Superdust
"You buy two, you're right with advertising."
"You buy two, you're right with advertising."

"Yesterday, it was easy to get into the country, which, in general, if you get something more expensive, you can bring it directly if you're not in the water."
"It's easy to install, the charge area is more common than the last one. It's also useful to check if the battery is sustainable."
"Nice model, kids love it, they don't know how to use it. Okay or no, but they're packed."
"The product's right, the speaker's a little small."
"I just bought a smart watch through Tiki and took it, and I did what I did with my sims, and I thought I'd give it back if I charged it."
The product's true description.
"Soft wire, nice box. Okay."
"Broken goods don't pay back, no client contact!"
"Both watches on receiving a 32G memory stick with an ad, and the front doesn't have an open clock, and it's tight, and it doesn't know if it's gonna fall out a few days later."
"The store says 2sp gets sate 10% buys xg nt shop don't mean 10 percent ain't worth it, but that's not a good attitude."
"It's okay, but I can't connect it to the phone."
"Immediate consultants, who have no text functions and can't name when they're in the phone book, can only save 10 numbers."
"The product shouldn't be bought. It's not a function, it's not worth the money."
"When he received a broken watch belt, he broke it, and he suggested that tiki trade it to Kwa."
"I just got the stuff I didn't use, so I don't know if it's good."
There's no sound like a cholera.
The watch doesn't support memory cards or anything.
I don't know what's in it.
"Good, listen to the simtoleel ok."
The clock's a little hard to use.
Unquality goods. The charge hatch can't cover up.
I can't read my 8g card. I can't hear you.
Can I get a message or a text from this phone?
The battery's been loose all the time.
"You don't get sim, you don't get sim."
"It's like the cataracts are flat, so when you're on the run or you're jumping around, it's like..."
Our baby loves Benko so much she loves an orange watch at the shop.
It's all right.
It's 100 percent new.
It's just as beautiful as there's no location on it.
You can't get your 32g memory card like an ad.
Okay.
"Nice pattern, but the battery's dead."
It's normal. It's nothing special.
It's hard to push. It's not sensitive.
"Code, code delivery, wrong color delivery, wrong color delivery."
Good.
Use it. It's good. It's good. It's good.
Where's my round head?
"It's pretty good, Pop."
"How can you buy two or two of them in a row for a couple of days? No, it's not working."
It's made in china that shop says made tarsor.
That's a good sound.
"Nice, convenient, no idea how long it takes but pasting it on the back."
"Speed delivery, orders at night, early morning notice, soft press, shakeout, get used to it for a while. Rats don't have to be silents, so they're just basics."
"Tiki delivers quickly, quite satisfied. The safe key, the low demand for text type, does not require high request; Layout will take some time to get to know it. Mouse is small so if you have large hands you will probably get tired of using it for a long time."
"Beautiful. Small. Simple. Layout keyboard is fine. Only Fn combination keys aren't useful, the key needs are too far away. You have to use both hands to press them. This is a popular structure, and it won't complain."
"Beautiful products, smooth typing, fine completion, low delay; however, the mouse is not noiseproof; the click is a bit loud, the keyboard types are soft"
"The typing keyboard is pretty loud, because the key is big and square, so knock on it, so buy on it."
Let's just say it's okay.
"The keyboard is too good at price range, the typing is extremely good at hand, highly recommension"
"The tap key is relatively fine, small, space-saving fit for someone who wants a neat, wireless corner."
"At the moment, there's a combot of the Volturitech wireless mousepad at Tiki Trading -- fast delivery, high-sharing -- the durability of Logotech is off the table, plus a Tiki Trading sales team -- it's kind of soft on the keyboard, and it's a 1000-dpi sensitivity -- it's worth a lot of money for a really good combo."
"The keyboard is a little small for a man as big as you are, so this keyboard is a little weird, but eventually it gets used to it."
"Nice, quiet keyboard. lt'll take time to verify, to make a quick delivery."
The tiki goods are still the best.
"The precipitation was small at first, it was quite complete; the brief experience of a key-surfing on the key seemed to be something that didn't go very well, so both the Vote 5 key."
"OK, that's the right quality, but receiver's attached to the box, so it's kind of hard to find."
"Black, tiny, but actually more beautiful than the pictures, keyboards and rats are very smooth, sensitive, very interesting, the Taki delivery guy is cute. <i>Taki now should still deliver close to 9:00 p.m.</i> <i>It's a surprise.</i>"
"At first, it's okay, we don't see any lights, but the quality of the keypad is okay."
"The key is a bit stymied, but the click has a word at the time, even if the new batteries change sometimes do."
"The battery cost a lot of money, bought a few times for pouring water on the keyboard and then broke the mouse, and then one time for breaking the mouse."
"Two buys, quality's okay."
The delivery's good.
Quality ok.
"Good product, two weeks worth of quality is fine, in the long run, I don't know..."
Fine. Good use.
Tiki let me ask you a question. I just bought this but I lost my head. I lost my signal.
"Quick delivery, I've just taken it short. Soft keyboards connect well."
"The package's right, okay."
"The keyboard is small, so it's kind of hard to hit."
"Quality, convenience, should buy."
"Unfortunately, it's only black that there's a Tiki program now that I can't buy white because it's urgent, so it's better to allow both colors to be applied in one program."
"The key is good, the type is smooth. The mouse is fine, the precision isn't very high. lt's generally delicious at the price range."
It's nice. It's good.
Good work.
Nice.
Use it fine.
"Fast delivery, sensibility, neatness for the office, new test, so we don't know how tough it is."
Good stuff.
Good.
"It's because of my birthday that my close friends gave me this keyboard and wireless mouse set. The very exact day of Tiki's book club, which opens up, it's got to be high-end, it's happy and on top of it. The keyboard is extremely neat, it's about 30 centimeters across, it's a terrible touch. Mouse has to say it's pretty good."
Good.
"After spending some time, we're screwed."
Okay.
"The product is described, the delivery is expected, cheap, small, convenient, easy to know."
"Hopefully, time will challenge the duability of the device."
"Using the product for over three months, feeling satisfied with the quality of this product, it's worth it!"
"A compact keyboard, a simple quick connection. A easy key to type, a sensitive mouse."
"Quick delivery, main product, very pleased.?"
"It's good, it's neat."
It's okay. It's only picking up signals from more than a meter.
So far it's still very OK. —------------------------------------------------------------
"Fast delivery, reasonable prices, good packing, very professional."
It's as beautiful as a quick delivery.
"Nice, steady."
"Good use, sensitive keys, sensitive mouse"
"Use it well, there's nothing to complain about. tiki delivers fast, logovol will last."
"It's beautiful and it's exactly the same, it's smooth, it's neat, it's convenient."
"It's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good."
Use ok. Good connection. The key was a little late. Please
"The goods are handy, the right keys should be good when you hit them, and already, the mice are sensitive."
Quick delivery.
"Image and quality similar to description, quick service"
Very pleased.
I don't know.
"Short, small, easy to use"
"The keyboard is very smooth, small. Mouse uses light and sensitive. The product is pretty good."
"Nice stuff. One set, now buys one more. Very good quality plus three-year warranty."
"Good use, one key's gone."
"The good product, the plug is run, the neat little place on the desk"
"The good stuff, the firm, should buy it. I don't know if it's bad, I don't know how it works."
Fine. Use it well.
Great.
"Small keyboard, filled with basic requests. The key keys are quite smooth, the mouse is noisy. Please ask your keyboard switch on/off is not there? The battery is not to be disabled."
"Mouse with a seizure, send it to tiki, report normal no errors, return it. If it's normal, don't take it because the mouse's left mouse is normally not jerked off like this, for the first time taking a keyboard-sharp mouse with a poor mouse quality, it's like quitting a mouse."
"Fast, neat delivery; nice look. Convenient; but I do a program, so I pick a keyboard that's a little small, it's easy to type wrong. Mouse sometimes doesn't work, neither does a key."
"Compared to before, the next item doesn't apply to packing well, good delivery."
"Small but not uniformly small product; keyboards that are not small; at worst, PCP quality is too weak; it's used a very long time to use a Gnaeustech mouse, and it's the best quality, and it's still M187; it's the same product that disappoints you, but it's still for Tiki."
Could not close temporary folder: %s
"Compared to the price of ~500k for a wireless-key set, it's relative, after about two months of using it, there's some comments like: Space key is kind of hard to press, it's got to be in between keys, it's not sticky, it's not sticky, it's not sticky, it's about half a meter distance."
"The packaged goods, which came in two weeks earlier than one day, came up with an error, reported the customer care department to retrieve the insurance, but were still not settled - times 1: 18 April 20, 2020 - times 2: 22 - April 20 - times 3: 23,20 - times April 20 - asked for immediate maintenance."
"Tiki delivers very quickly, and less than 2 hours has been received, the keyboard is nice and neat, the mouse is small and with the hands but the sensitivity is good."
"The keyboard and the mouse are nice, sensitive, and it's kind of small."
"I ordered a product from 31/5, got a mouse that I could use at a distance of more than 1 meter, while log NFL showed a maximum of 10 mt? the mouse completely lit the light and the weak signal, which is close to usb to use, which is less than 1mt. Do I use more spham of log r and never suspect the quality of whether this is the log? the claim for tpk and the weak signal that I've been able to deliver to the third time and receive from the previous line of evidence that is not true?"
"Did I buy this sp (Black), September08/2019, I got the product, but today, my keyboard broke the ""Bitter"" button, so what am I going to do?"
"I just got it, I'm new, I'm not fit for layout so I can't type fast, if you need me, I'm half price."
"I bought two keyboard sets, but the first one after receiving a mouse action, but the key didn't, tried three of them, and they all came back with the following results; I called Tiki operator that day; the next day someone called me and told me that someone was going to pick up the package, but I didn't see anyone call me or contact me again."
This isn't really good. The most unstable connection is the mouse part. Keyboard OK but the mouse continues to float and doesn't respond. Dropping the grid after six hours after use of a stringed mouse. This happens at a distance from one meter up.
"I bought it in April 2019, and so far the Bluetooth connection has failed to receive a signal, unable to use the mouse and keyboard."
"You just bought it, it's boring!"
What kind of delivery do we use without receiver?
"I can't use it, I can't do it, I can't do it, I can't do it, I can't give it back just yesterday."
It's good within this amount of money.
"The keyboard's fine, but the mouse's barely working."
"The press didn't match the hand, the price was right."
Keyboard OK but naughty mice don't work
"The keyboard is pretty good, the mouse is long gone, so consider buying your own keyboard and mouse, as if you weren't using a waste mouse."
"The package is packed well, the keyboard is good but the mouse is not picking up any signals. The delivery date is 8-5-2019."
the product is to blame
Use fuckingoec
"I'll buy you a woman, a keyboard and a white mouse."
"It's small and fine, but it's a little small, but it's hard to use."
It's like Chinese stuff. It's boring.
"Rats and Capable keyboards, sustainable batteries"
"It's good, but it's limited that the yellow empire is afraid to use it for a time. It's dirty. And the keyboard has a switch, like a mouse, it's scared of the battery."
"The key is also light, mouse and sensor keys. The delivery is quick."
"It started out a little bit, but after one or two times it's over, a steady connection, a light price, a reasonable price."
Long-term delivery.
"It's okay, but it looks a little bit like a toy."
Four batteries. One keyboard. An infrared mouse.
Bad connection
"TO THINK ABOUT, INTERNATIONAL DIVIDATIONS, THE DIFFERENT DIFFERENT BROUGHT FOR A BROTHER OF A BROTHER"
"I just bought one, and the mouse doesn't light the lights, but it begs for mercy."

"It's distorted, it's fragile, it's unpreserved."
That doesn't sound good.
Good.
"Yeah, it's okay, it's okay. It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay."
"It's within the price range. Okay, but I don't know if it's the same company, but 700k is pretty stupid."
Take the same color from the sample.
"Two holes, but there's only one small speaker inside, which sounds pretty normal."

Good audio quality, good bass that also sounds, has not tried water resistance and “a constant use of batteries, so don’t know how... when you get back, remember (1) to sign up for the Commerator in Thailand (with QRR code to scan)), (2) read the manual carefully so as not to be fast for use and (3) try to fill the battery... with ever since Tiki feels like a dish."

"I've bought a lot of Anker's products on Tiki, this cable, this big solid cable, the cable is wrapped up to five layers, and there's a lot more bulletproof material, and there's a lot of certainty, and there's a four-foot-by-a-eight long wire plug in there, and there's a long cable, and there's a red cable on Anker's, and there's a nice box, and there's a cable in there's a cable, and there's too much Anker, and there's a long support if there's a suit."

"Because the quality of the charge is so good that I have to buy Anker's quick charge, Tiki is really good at selling goods, so the price of sp is 240k, and the wire is hard, and the wire is hard, and it's six feet long, and it's rolling back and forth, Tiki delivers fast, and it's packed carefully."

It's okay to use it. I don't know how strong it is.
"I bought a piece of antler wire, just delivered on Saturday, October 7,20, today is October 10,20, charge four times, and don't go into the battery."
"I put an iphone charge on it, but what kind of charge cable is this?"
"I bought a cable and adapter anker (24w) for nearly 700k, and I found that using more than a month charge for 8+ would not be able to use the fingerprints."
"It's time for early delivery. A day of careful wrap-ins. The main product. Okay, long-term use takes time to test it."
"Wires, tough ones, I hope they're sustainable."
"It's only been two and a half months until this morning. It's officially dead; there's a charge signal that doesn't go in, try for three phones, and it won't change its plug."
"Big, rough, hard cable, two weeks of charging, okay."
"It's a waste of quality, a buy-in charge for one place, it's not moving, it's only using over two months already."
"I buy it new. Okay. I can't even get it in for a month. Now, can you buy more than 300k?"
"The product's a little bit longer than the iphone plug, so it's left over so the rat's loose and it doesn't eat electricity."
"SUCCESS, A MONTH DIFFERENT DIFFERENTS ARE UNDERSTANDED."
"The wire's fine, but it's pretty fast."
"Always trust to use anker's product, but recently the quality of the product's endurance has dropped dramatically."
The utility length is stable in Saigon.
"I've got a few days of free charge, too bad quality."
The new one for a month failed to charge when it didn't work.
"It's a little expensive, it's a little long, it looks good."
Very pleased.
Tiki's slow delivery.
Good.
The short-term product failed
It'll take you a while longer before you're finished with it.
The last two weeks have been broken.
It's easy to cut the internal cord. It's not good.
"On average, three months of damage?"
Unloaded purchase product has to deal with Tiki star
I've only been able to buy more than a month. How is it that I can't charge my warranty?

"Big, solid, packaged, quick, but don't know the quality will be ntn"
"The cable used very well, it's faster than the real iphone cable."
"The charge line is okay, solid and solid."
I don't need a table.
Two-day delivery is always expected.

"Super-splitting, running out of backpacks, singing well, listening to music okay, super sensitive, going out with this group you've got so much fun, I've bought a speaker three times, I'm pretty happy, I'm going to back you up."
"It's perfect, it's okay, it's really strong, it's good for a small speaker, it's easy to sing."
Thank you.

Quick end of the sentence
"See, that's okay."
Sounds good.
"I have to charge my MDI to get it right. The sound is solid, the sound is sound, and the durability is long before I can evaluate it."

Is there anyone who can't get access to a laptop like me?
"It's a little small for the image, so it's easier to flip the phone."
"Ok at the price range, there's a point that's hard to put behind it."
The base is a little low.
"It looks like this rack is a small one, a point because the salesman doesn't describe it, or deliberately doesn't describe it."
It's very beautiful. It's very pleased with the standard order.
The good material that the package delivers from HN into HCM.
Not as expected. Be improved.
"Too bad, the row of errors opens the piece of rubber"
"All right, all right, let's move all the way across."
"It's a little small for your dt but it's still holding against falling, it's cheap, but it's still delicious and it's still necessary."

"I see speakers without bass after a month, but when I turn on the bass from the app, there's music, there's a sound inside and it's great, when I turn on the bass from the app, it's okay, so buy it."
"The good, stable product at such a price, I've bought it in a lot of places and nowhere is it that I'm as pleased as this place is."

It's nice. It's 3 o'clock sharp.

The original purpose was to attach mice to holiday games for relief. • ABOUT SEPORTHS - A continuous 2 hours without a hot signal - can be used to connect cell batteries - small, business itself : ON TIBERT - 2 HlTHS that speed up, approximately one hour - the sake of Sile product should be worth - Tiki now 39/2kmpm is slightly low.=/."

"- It's extremely slow. - There's no data transfer feature like a product description - generally if I can give zero stars, I'll give it, because this product totally deserves that evaluation because it's worth it, even if it's worth it, it can't be asked very high, but I just want the family to describe the product's function properly, don't describe a trade line that's a waste of time for customers."
"The product received the ads and was delivered completely mistakenly, unaware of whether it was a shop or a packaged product, which was very oppressive to the customers, suggesting that next time you buy it directly, you'll be mistaken because it's an unacceptable error."
"You don't ""pro"", you don't know what's high, but you don't look good at the angle."
The product doesn't have a label envelope. It's closed in the tiki case. Of course it's not working.
"It takes a while to set it up, to get mad because you get something like this, which is the opposite of the need."
"We don't know the quality yet, but we're not sure what it looks like."

This product doesn't support LEO Note 10 up (helped for iphone 11pro up) and doesn't support image output via hub type C to HDVI/DVI/VGA....so you notice when buying.
"I bought it to plug in my headphones and I found it very effective, but it was made of very sustainable metal."
"I got the product, but it's not working, I can't connect it, I can't use the mouse and the hub on the device, Surface Pro, Mac Air and Mac Pro."
Bringing back the hub divides Ugreen's gate and lights up but plugs or memory cards don't take it.
Quick delivery.
I can't get it back!
"It's small, it's beautiful, it's data and hearing."
Every sin is expensive compared to energy.
It's not gonna work. It's not gonna work.
It's not very sensitive.
The quality of data transfers is too bad.
I can't use it. It's a waste of money.
"The product uses bad stuff, it uses cop files. It's too long, so does the battery charge."
Good.
"It's still in the battery, but the quality of the peacock's a bit bad."
Start off OK but loose
It's not very sophisticated. It's a quick delivery.
"Can't use it, can't get on the machine"
It's good to use. There's something much more convenient than a coal store.
Okay.
The product's stable. Small and easy. Very pleased.
The charge's too slow.
It's very small and beautiful. It's good to use the sustainable hope. It's a day early to deliver the cave.

"Mouse handles well, nice, quick delivery, smooth, sensitive, smooth mouse moves"
"The mouse is quite smooth, handy, light-clicking, rather rather aggravating figure."
Okay.

It's beautiful!!!!

"Rats like it very much because they're high-sensitivity, they can hold their hands."

"If you don't spend less than a year, double-clicked even if you use very little and you don't play games, you'll be told to run back and forth, and eventually you won't be able to preserve yourself because you're closed."
Transport is distorted. I'm not happy with this transportation service.
"Rats are fine, but no gifts."
Longtime use with double clicks
"It's just open, the wheel's broken, it's boring, it doesn't change any more."
That's OK. The key is not sensitive.
Rats must be weak before they hit the mouse.
"Rats use okay, I look a little silly for each of us."
"Three days of use, double click."
The feeling of a mouse wire is a little thin.
"Rats are a bit long, but okay."
Pretty good at the price.

"Good product, beautiful model, sounds very good."
Fast delivery store. Full accessories. It's kind of like speaker colors on the outside. It's better than the picture.
"Tiki packaged carefully. Placed TikiNow, so 2 hours ago you got it at home. As for your product, you're satisfied with the money, because you're listening to music on the Colonify, if you don't know whether it's good or if it's because it's good or if it's because it's made in younger, or if you're listening to old speakers. About the battery time:"
"In fact, I've spent two weeks trying to evaluate the product - > blip: quite fine - Povray: taking four days (an average of one hour 15 minutes a day) just off - quickly connect and automatically turn off the machine when you don't use the switch - > Point: It's about 200,000 minutes till you stop playing the video - so buy everyone!"
It's pretty light on the machine. It's fast on Bluetooth. It's good music quality to buy.
"It's an unexpected delivery store, it's a very sensitive phaser, it's a good sound, people won't regret it, right?"

That's a great sound speaker. The design outside looks like a picture.
It's good. It's good. It's good.

"Easy, multi-tasking, good audio, packaged"
Nice speaker looks like a picture. And the sound part I see is pretty ok. The bass tress is fine.

"After a few days I've also got his sister, the photo-like product, not the head of a goat."
"The image is exactly what it looks like, but the battery charge doesn't know when it's full to know and stop charging."

"I don't know if it's caused by a bug on the machine or the charge attached to the box that comes in when you don't come in, and the sound that's really heavy on the music once in a while is a headache."
So don't buy anything that doesn't have credit.
"I just need to hear your voice so the quality is okay, but what about the volume?"
"Good sound, good sound, just like I said."

It's good. It's good. It's good for teachers.

As usual, Tiki delivers very quickly and very early a day as planned by the order (the one I love most when I buy on Tiki Trading's special supply site) this time there's a problem with the shipper job, but the customer support center has been very good and very useful, so thank you very much."

"Rats like it, your hands don't use the weights that come with it."
"Mouse has spent a few days, very kind of content, very easy to use help. Set up all buttons at once, optimum for the job."
It's better than Logotech Muffin 3S. It's better to use a wire-based desktop.
The Voltatech is so good that it's too good to notice. Nothing compared to the MMA Master rats. Form holding it seems more comfortable than the MUTO Master 3 (or maybe it's a little small).
"I've been using super-use smooth, even though I can't find my warranty, but I've used it before I've used it to g302 so I don't believe it's okay."
The best mouse clicking is within the price range.
"I got a new version of g502 heroes 16k, this one with an umbrella wire, and the ones who get the plastic wire are g502 heroes 25k, and they're both the same, so don't get it."

It's not even an hour. It's a smooth touch. It's a great deal.
"When I got the package, I got all the accessories, and I was so happy about the product I got."
But I'm still getting used to the new mouse (because it's heavier than the old mouse - also Logitech Gaming Mouse) and not used to the new mouse roll -- pretty sensitive.

"It's smooth, but it's a little smooth about the mouse that's hit lightly. It also turns itself into a game. It changes weapons. It's a little uncomfortable."
"Tiki delivers quickly, the mouse is sensitive, with multiple functional buttons"
"Take a firm hand, have more weight to help the mouse grow and also cool-looking design."
That's great. But it's easy to fall off when you hit woooo.

"Buy 2G more like that in *** only 49Baht, which is cheaper than 11 Baht if you buy it on a guide's page."
"We've got a plant for sim, we've got to get to Thailand airport, we've got to use it immediately, we've got to connect the network."
"Sim's well-used, over the sp deadline, but it's been extended exactly as TadaViet Notre reports!"
"It's high speed, it's in the city, it's in the city, it's good to use it right now."
Okay.

"The product of Tiki Palace is an asset outside of the United States Security Services Department, which has been present at VN for the best man in Saigon."

"Sim used it well, it's convenient to use Thai, we go five days, but we don't use all our skins, but we don't use 4G all the time because there's a network support over there, so if you're careful, you can go to Thailand first, you can use bt."

"The goods, the envelopes carefully, carefully, very pleased."

"Pulling the charge off the plug was an error, and the press didn't take this part out of the paper, and they both got the same charge."
The package's right. The delivery's too slow.
"It's a beautiful wooden shell, it sounds good, it doesn't sound good, it doesn't work very well because it's that cheap."
"I've got a three-and-a-half line, and I've got my computer, and I've got my favorite soccer player, and I've got another one for the white one."
"Nice form, buffalo battery, sounds like you can't make it in big space, you can hear it in small rooms, you can change the speaker's voice when you hear it."
"It's cheap, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good."

"Be careful with the shock-proof package, that's a good sound speaker."
"It's good, it smells like wood, you deliver it, it's worth it."
The bar is great for the Acoustic music line. It's always been open for about 30 to 40 percent. It's a great performance.
"The good stuff is well packed, the sound sounds good, the price is cheap, the duability to use."
"I'll listen to you, or I'll introduce you to your friends."
It's a solid shell. It's a good sound.
That's a great speaker.
That's great.
"Buying all the batteries for the first time, plugging in the source, not coming up, is it warranted or swapped?"
"2 o'clock fast. - 2 o'clock cheap 39k, by accident read 1 review of a friend who said that buying from the tech supplier was fine at that price and really thank you very much, because bass is okay, the switch button, stops very sensitive!"
"Bass is pretty good, and at this price, that sounds good."
"The sound of the bass or, on the large side, adjust the earpiece in the set phone is both sides, fine use."
"By sharing with those who buy it, it's all about earphones. OK, I mean, neither of us is wrong. So everybody's wrong."
"I've also been shopping on tiki. But this is the last time I've been down for five days, and I haven't seen anything in five days. I'm really disappointed, but I still have a 5-star store because it's not related to the shop, and I'm going to judge one star for this app on CH Play."
"Good volume, steady earpiece, reasonable delivery time, funny shipper, five stars for shop and shipper."
"Advantage - super-cost - sound is fine - quality oke, perfect good point - it's hard to wear - easy to wear - to get off when the p/s deliver is earlier than expected 2 days, tiki box is twice the size of the product box, the product box is probably a little bit twisted due to the delivery process"
"Fast delivery, whole set, sound clear, good at this price is too OK"
"Nice hearing, very well heard, delivered super fast, one day got the package."
"The ear is cheap but the quality is too good. and when you listen to metalcore, the bass is clear as well as able to distinguish specific instruments."
"The delivery was quick in the morning, but in the afternoon there was a package, a package, a very good headset, everything with about 40K."
"Okay, nice."
"The headset has a piece of rubber that won't hurt your ears, but it's really nice, and it's really good to spend it on something as wonderful as this?"
"I don't know what it sounds like when I hear it, but I feel like it's small, but I'm fine listening to music."
It's so great. I want to shop. Just come and get people growing.
"Quality product, reasonable price"
"Nice ears, nice boxes, good ears."
It's good to have a game on. Sounds good.
"The sound is strong, but there's not a detail that's only acceptable... the sound sacqs sound like it's kind of boring in the picture..."
Very pleased!
"sp sounds good for this price, too quality. Okay. Next time, we'll support the shop."
"Excellent sound very clear and t-o, cheap, I'll put another one in."
"Sound's good within the price range, sounds enough to meet basic needs."
"I've bought and used two of them, negative and product quality compared to top-of-the-box, buying and playing PUBG sounds very good."
"It's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's easy to use."
Okay.
"It's warm, Bass strong, it's good to hear."
"The earpiece is good and quality, and it sounds cheap, and it's very satisfying. Thank you very much. Thank you very much."
"You know, when you get your headset, because your headset is so good, you can wrap it up and be careful."
"I bought this 50 percent discount (59K), which is extremely satisfying than what I bought, the relative quality of sound, compared to that of my friend (300K), is a little less likely (of course) before I buy a lot of comments or a lot of hearing notes, but I feel it's very good to wear, it's a long time without pain, it's easy to fall, it's very satisfying to say, it's worth five)."
It's okay. It's good. It's good.
"I've only used one of these before... I've bought it a couple times, I've got a good sound, bass, I've got a loud sound. I've heard every single foot on this thing."
"Good product, prestigious shop."
"The delivery was pretty good, the nipples were just one side, the color was on the spot, the color was on the red, and it's quite fitting. It's just that one side sounds good and one side is on average, and you deliver pretty close."
"Nice stuff. Cheap, sounds good. Good quality?"
I don't know if you can afford this kind of headset.
"Fast delivery, very good product quality."
"I've been buying for three months, but now I've written my notes, the earpiece is a really good form of wire, which is loud but one thing I don't like is that it's a little hard to put in the other ear and it's okay."
The bass sound sounds really good.
It's cool and beautiful because it's big and it's strong.
"Every time I buy it, it's 50 to 70 for an sp. It makes sense. But it's more expensive to consider. There's a huge defect that's easy to fall out of the ear and it's hard to hear, but it's not much more expensive to spend on, so I'm not getting any higher."
"Cover your ears, rubber rings are a little bigger than your ears, sounds good."
I don't know about bass or anything but it's good to hear a video of the screen. It's not like I'm listening at a price like this. Why don't you buy it so quickly?
"Good use without fear, fair delivery, tes 2 smoothes, standard bass buffer not slipped (with enough to use)"
"The earpiece is very high at a cost of fine design, worth money."
The delivery is less than a day early. Good sound. Packed as best you could for five stars.
"Tiki delivery is good and fast, quality product."
"Why does my firm say ""Mijiaer by Langsdom"", I see people's names as Langsdom, but it's okay, there's sounds on both sides, there's 2tun, there's no comment yet."
"The headset's pretty good, right? Nine-tenths?"
sp good
"The earpiece sounds good and clear, long and untangled when you put it in your pocket or bag."
"The earpieces are beautiful, elegant, the wire seems solid, the box and the envelope look very professional."
"The bass ear is very good, very loud, and there's a poor grip on the button, so it's easy to fall out of the ear, although the quality of sound is good."
The earpiece is very good. The delivery is very good. Very good.
"About delivery: Tiki is very carefully packed, ear box is also packed with an extra box that is very sure and beautiful about the product:"
"The sound is loud, I'm not a professional but I'm okay right now, I'm worried about how long it's going to last, the box has a stamp, the QR code, the white one doesn't know what it looks like but the black one's a little bit old."
I can't believe it's a pretty good price. Sound is quite acceptable. It's packed too well.
Sounds good.
"It's good, it's good, it's quick, it's good. It's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good."
"The delivery was on schedule, the product was described, but the ear button was a little loose, easily slipped."
Very nice.
"The quality product, it's very OK."
"The hearing is good, the listening is good, the experiencing of small ears is easy to wear, but whatever the earpiece is at, it's too good a price."
"Tiki delivers fast, 3 days earlier, ears sound like pictures, good left, loud sound, play/pause button, hopefully for long term, which is pretty cheap."

I don't know.

"The ear is packed, the delivery is fast, the strength is not debated."
"It's so loud, it's for pubg gamers, you should buy it."
Very good.
It's a pleasure. It's the same image. It's great bass.
I just ordered the order on the 16th and tiki is here now.
"I've got these ear-hearing products called Tai Langsdom Super Bass JM26, which are delivered with pictures, beautiful, sustainable use, good sound."
"At first, I thought it wouldn't work out at this price, but it really sounds good. It's warm music, it's kind of loose at first, but it's okay to get used to it."
"Odo 3 times, but destroyed until the last t4 we had access to the product. Okay, well, that's a good thing to wait."
"Use it well, whether it lasts or not."
Good.

"The product ok, the sound quality relative to the price"
"The bass dam is so clear, I want to buy it, I should buy it right away."
"It's not cheap, but quality isn't cheap. Sounds good, but I'm sure I can hear you."
The earpiece stuffed Langsdom super bass jm26 quality sound; the package service and the shipping of tiki good.
"Fast delivery, packaged goods, earpieces still fresh and intact, bass quality not to argue, it's great!"
"At this price range it's okay, corals are like descriptions, nice package, quick stuff."
"Beautiful goods, quick delivery, right patterns, well packed goods."
"Great, cheap, worth the price, same product as the description."
It's okay.
Format ok which quality does not know ntn. must wait a tg look
"It's really exciting. It's really good. I don't know if I've just bought it, so I don't know if it's good enough for five."
"I'm very pleased with the product, and tiki delivery is fast."
"Nice headset, good quality, good price."
"It's very good to buy from TIVI, and I hope next time it's good to buy."
There's nothing to look at compared to the price.
I've got two hours of quick delivery on the earpiece and I've got hihi on my hands!!!!!
Good stuff.
"The bass's fine, but the bass's a little off the hook."
Use your ears quite well!
"For a long time it shall be used well; but for a long time it shall continue; for a long time it shall endure, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and,"
"It's cheap, but it's sustainable, quality sounds good."
Where's the volume adjustment button?
I'm pleased with the product.
Okkkkkkkkkk Okkkkkkkkk Okkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk
Did you deliver the package on time? Huh???????????????????????????????????????
That sounds good. We'll make a quick delivery today. We'll make it tomorrow.
It's cool. The delivery officer is okay. I hope tiki gets a lot of customers.
"Quick delivery nice package ears soundproof pretty good, model also nice."
"The good stuff is good, the good stuff is good, the good stuff is good, the good stuff is good, the good stuff is good, the good stuff is great."
"The sound sounds good, but every crime is listening or slipping."
"It's easy for the ear to fall, it's a little small for the picture, but it's a sure thing."
"It's good for the price, guys."
"I'm telling you, it's a quick delivery, so it's a good deal."
"Outdoor sounds good, mic's fine, wire's not loose."
It's a pleasure. It's beautiful. It's a quick delivery.
"Listen, it sounds good, but it's not the same color as it is in the picture."
"Fast delivery, resuscitation, good sounds, a little loud, and it's easy to slip, it's not sure, it's not strong enough, it's always good sp."
audiocassette used to fit clients.
"Some people say they fall out of their ears, but they're so normal, so appropriate!!!!"
The earpiece is very good. The low cost is very sustainable.
Very good sp good quality matching price
The right quality of the price of money buys the right quality of the price of money.
The beautiful sustainable quality sounds pretty good at the cost of quick delivery and quality
"When wearing them, outside sounds are significantly down, so it shouldn't be wearing them on the road."
"Listen to good music, game footsteps are very clear. Five stars."
"As far as I can tell, it sounds good with Mic... but it's a little hard to fall in your ear, it's okay to use it!"
"I buy two days when my right ear hears at a time, does the shop have a warranty?"
"Quick delivery, excellent quality."
I don't know how long it's gonna take you to deliver the goods on the right day.
The product's good. Thought it was onl.
"It's a beautiful product, just like the model, that's a great use."
"Okay, bass is fine, it's always getting out of your ears, it's a bit of a pain in your ears."
"The bass's good, it's very expensive, but it's a bit of a big hole, and it's a long earache."
"Quick delivery, good headset, but no volume adjustment button."
The ear sounds good!!! This is good for price!!!!!!!!!
The bass sounds great!
"The earpiece's very, very clear, but when you put it in your little dust hole, it's OK, it's worth it!"
"The package, the material is very good at the price range, but since they're trading these two factors, the quality of sound isn't high."
"The package is very, very carefully there's something in the box that's so big?, what is it that's so big, the box that's earmarked?, which is fast, which sounds pretty good compared to the cost of four?"
"The one in the ear and the one in the ear, the one in the ear, the one in the ear, the one in the ear. The one in the ear, the one in the ear, the one in the ear, the one in the ear, the one in the ear, the one in the ear."
"A little satisfaction compared to the cheap product, but the flaws for those of you who have small ears are not going to be able to wear them, because the nodes are always down, because the product isn't going to add large or small sizes to the right person's ears; that's the biggest subtraction; the earpiece is fine, it's not going to be loud, it's not going to be too good, it's not going to be much better, it's not going to be more demanding."
"You really don't have to be too cheap to buy... and because Mik is slow to buy two days, he can't hear you."
"Don't you understand why? It's clear that I ordered the same order, but delivered the same thing?"
"After all this time, everyone who's listening to the story will be here for some time."
"I actually use and maintain it very carefully, but maybe she's got a very long life. Yeah, on the second day, her ears are broken, she can't hear, and a week later, both sides have lost her last breath -- and it ends up buying an ear that she enjoys for a week."
"I chose this earpiece because I kind of liked to design a flat wire, which seemed to be more permanent than a round wire, which was kind of hard to wear, but after almost three months of use, at first it was gently touched, shake where jack connected to the wire, and then it was completely broken, the fastest record of those hearing ears that I used."
"The sound doesn't sound good because too many basses are hard to stick to their ears, and the little ear is going to hurt to wear for long without a piece of hearing rubber to fit each kind of ear, and the correct button only has a stop/play button, and it doesn't make much difference, even if it buys a discount, it's better to spend a little bit of money."
"The airline is definitely available now when it comes out, where the buttons are missing in part:"
Can't use it too bad.
"It's pretty good to deliver fast, but the delivery officer's attitude is pretty bad. I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, but the delivery guy's attitude is pretty bad, he delivers the house, and he's supposed to be out on an appointment, and he's five minutes late because he's busy at work, and he's giving the customer 1 points except for you to deliver the delivery."
"The hearing was good at first, it was beautiful, it didn't matter, it didn't matter, I dropped my ear twice, so now I've broken one side, and it hasn't been in a month."
"You've been listening to me for a month, but I've been thinking about the fact that if I don't get it for three days, I've been throwing it all over for a month, and it's okay with my ears, but I'm no bigger than I was wearing it when I dropped, and if I'm on my feet, it's probably not my problem."
"The box I bought didn't have an extra buffer button to replace it with, but there was only one pair of cushions attached to the headset, which was made of plastic, which was very hard to hold on to when listening to music because it was very easy to fall out."
"Headsets are good, ears are loose when you're listening."
"The product is cheap, but it doesn't work because it only listens to one ear. It's uncomfortable because it doesn't taste good in the song."
I'll take a closer look at the shop.
"The shop you're a friendly talker, and before you go, the product is cheap, and the cost is not high, and the hearing ear is small, so it's better to keep one."
"It's a lot of pain, but it's okay."
"Place two of them, but when you get the open item there's only one:((())"
"One of them is missing. One of them is hearing, one on the right, and the other on the other."
That fits the price price.
"Compared to the price of money, design like this looks pretty good, it's pretty nice, but one side listens small, but that's not much."
Have you successfully delivered your clients who didn't get it successfully?
"His headset is steady, he's sure, his ears aren't working for this kind of stuff, he's loose, he's loose, he's out, so he's not used very often."
Quick delivery. Buttons don't work. Sound was pretty good at first.
"It's not cheap, but quality's bad, so it's quick to think before you buy it."
"I've just bought it open and it feels like it's over, but sd's fine bass."
"I got it on June 18th, which is more than 20 days ago. And as a result, less than a few days ago, my hearing ear was broken."
Okay.
"Besides, the mic side is healthy and healthy."
A little pain in the ears.
"The color's a little lighter than the picture, which sounds good on the bass, nice packing, quality that needs to be checked over time."
"Anyway, the price from 50 to 100K is very good, but the strepts are pretty big, and they don't have a replacement, so my ears are pretty small, so I can barely fit, and I can hear for a long time, and it's going to hurt my ears, and I'm going to evaluate a four-quarter star product."
The sound's pretty good. The only weakness is to wear it down easily.
g
"The rubber is dirty, I don't know if it's the production or the goods for so long, to be able to hear the music, to be unsympathetic."
I don't know if the sound quality is going to be down or k. But the only thing on the ear box with instructions is to press the round button two-thirds to next/previous song when I listen to the music but I've tried and I can do it.
"Shipper's doing it like a beet, and on the order it's a successful delivery, but we haven't got the drop yet."
"It's funny how Tiki buys the oil that ha z buys is 5/42018 z that today on March 3,2018 I deliver the goods and I don't get the goods."
Okay.
"Bad music ear, phone call. Okay, good fire at the price line for phone chat."
"The bass earpiece is pretty good, but it's hard, and it's got a lot of ears on it, and it's got a lot on it, and it's got a lot on it, and it's got a lot on it, and it's got a lot on it, and it's got a lot on it, and it's got a lot on it."
I'm guessing Jack's a little out of sync with the standard gate 3.5mm so that sometimes the ear can only hear one side of the right side of it.
"The bass ear is strong but the ear is hard to hear, not fixed for long, five minutes to fall."
"It's all right, but it's very sharp, it's not going to go deep, it's hard to get fixed, and the cable that comes with it to someone who doesn't know how to use it is useless."
"The prototype is relatively beautiful, the bass is smooth, the sound is a bit loud but acceptable, but the error product on both sides of the ear is not equal, on one side is a large speech on one side."
"I've been working on my phone for a month and I've lost my ear, anyway, whatever my money is."
"It doesn't sound like it's going to be all the time. It's going to be all the time, and it's going to be all the time, and it's going to be all the time, and it's going to be all the time, and it's going to be all the time, and it's going to be all the time, and it's going to be all right."
"The product, it looks like it's just been bought less than five hours. It's said it's an unpleasant way to use it for a long time."
"The earpiece's thin, so it's easy to cut. Guys, we've been through three days and it's been broken."
"I'm fine. I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good."
"The sound's fine, loud, clear, sound is good, but the strength's not high, we're going to have a month."
For a while I feel like I'm listening to you for a second and you can't get up the mic. You can't hear me over there. You don't know if there's a warrant?
"Whatever it is, it'll be fine."
The earpiece's working after a month's failure. The mic's out.
"And just as you're reflecting, the earpiece is pretty big, and it's pretty good for the sound, and the other three months is off, and the next month, it goes both ways."
I don't know where the people's conscience is.
"You're not listening, you're not being touched at jack's house when you hear you're on both sides."
"Sticking to a pc microphone can't handle it, buying it mostly because of the mic that you can't afford to be disappointed with."
"The earpiece looks nice, but it's hard to wear. It's big, it's kind of shy."
"It's over and it's been waiting a long time to pee. It's like a shop, it's a two-hour drop."
"His headsets are huge, his earpieces are kept falling out."
"Just like the description, don't listen very often because your ears hurt a little."
"The delivery officer is not good, has a good attitude for the guests, wants tiki to reconsider."
"It's not loud but loud, it's unscramble, it's given a cable, but I'm using an amploid that's given a cable."
"It's the same, but long-term design should be bought if it's not Joey's."
Okay.
Accepted sounds kindly packed carefully...
Listen to music ok beautiful color smooth male high mass
"It's temporary, it's not just volume, it's sounds good."
"It takes about a month to open up. Try it again, but it's not easy, but I'd like to ask the shop for attention. Thank you."
"It's not good rubber material, it's allergic and itchy ears, it's loud, it's loud, it's easy to fall out of your ears."
It sounds pretty good. It's like April through November. It's probably all his money. It's only temporary.
"Nice headset, but it's only been a month. It's broken on one side."
"It's okay. It's okay. It's okay, it's okay. It's been a week, but nothing's wrong."
"It's a temporary sound, a general amount of money."
"It's kind of puppet-proof, and it sounds really good, but when you put it in your ear, it keeps falling out of your ears, except for that point, everything's fine."
It's good. It's good. It's good.
"The ear is a little bit similar to the shape, but it's smaller, so it's easy to wear, and there's no volume correction, and there's no replacements."
"The button's a little stiff, the left ear, the right ear's a little tight because of your ear."
"Good sound quality, fast delivery, so I'm very confident on tiki, but the ear is too fast for one side."
"I'm buying two products that TIVI only delivers one, and I charge two."
"The sound's quite good, the code's beautiful, but it's easy to slip when it's wearing it, and it's annoying."
Okay.
It's pretty good for the price. It's still good for a month.
Why did we order two of them with one of them?
Tot
"The hearing's a bit heavy when you put it in your ear, and the sound's fine, not so good."
"After a month of non-use use, it's a dead end."
"This is a very expensive product, which is a pretty good quality, with a spare ear button, which is better:"
"The product looks like it's a long time ago, there's a scandal. I don't know why."
"The sound of the fine soft price has a lovely pair, but the ears are loose and fall with little ears."
"I've got two or three hours on my headset. I've lost one earphone, I've got bass."
Why did you give me a purse with an earpiece you can't see? The delivery doesn't have an extra gift like you said it would.
"You know, reviews are made. Write things you don't see coming out of your mouth."
It's okay. It's really annoying to talk. It's not cool. It's just any money.
"Well, that's good, but it doesn't sound good. There's no beat and pass."
"The sound's pretty normal, the ear's loose, and if it's been going on for a long time, it's kind of hard on your ears."
"It's big, it's good, but it's bad. That's why you're mad, you're buying it twice."
"Maybe the big bass should be unacquainted, it's blacked out, it's buttoned in."
"Vulnerable, especially the play/strop button, but the quick delivery."
It wasn't even a month ago. The warranty was too complicated.
I'll be back in a couple of days.
"It's a little big, and it's a lot of ear pain, and it sounds good, and it's a lot better than 50K."
"Quick delivery, beautiful form like picture, temporary sound."
"After 3 months of using one earpiece, the quality fits the price."
"That's the price. Okay, but for one time, you'll lose the ear pad. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no"
"Inside the ear box, there's no substitute earplugs, one ear can hear."
"Quick delivery. The best is tiki. I can hear you, but the button's too hard. It's a pain in the ears."
It's just bought this afternoon. Why do you have rubber nipples in the box that don't exist?
"It's not what I've heard, it's what I heard, it's what I heard, it's what I heard, it's what I heard, it's what I heard, it's what I heard, it's what I heard, it's what I heard, it's what I heard, it's what I heard, it's what I heard, it's what I heard, it's what I heard, it's what I heard."
"Poor quality, two, three days' use and it's gone."
"The design of the edge of the earpiece is beautiful, but when used, it causes pain in the ear."
"Well, that sounds like a pretty good model, but it's a little less bass, right, eight-tenths in general."
"It sounds good, it sounds good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, but it's hard for the head to hear, it's hard to reach the ears, it's hard to hear, it's hard to hear, it's hard to hear."
"Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
The product is good.
I can't hear you.
"Come on, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go!"
He said he's coming to the delivery day and he hasn't seen anyone else connected. He's so disappointed.
"I don't know. I don't know. I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know."
"Sounds good, but design is hard to wear in your ears, you have to keep it in your ears."
The wire's better than the earphones that follow the machine. Okay. It's good to see you.
"The delivery is long, not long gone. Lost the earpiece."
"Thank you, tiki."
"Headsets at a price of under 100k, card switch, clamp, sounds pretty good."
I don't know what price it's gonna cost. It's gonna suck.
It's taking so long to deliver. It's too much time planned.
"The earpiece's a little loose, not even for a month is broken. (((())"
"sp is pretty good, ears are a little loud, so it's hard to put in your ears."
The ears often slip out of their ears: (Surely they are in their ears:)
Ibid....
It's not safe. It's not safe. It's not safe.
It's expensive. I want to return the product. How can I return it?
May I ask who I need warranty to contact?
"That's okay. The bass is clear. The liquid ear, it falls off when you wear it."
Your headset doesn't have a replacement rubber.
"The product's good, but the ear's a little big, so it's easy to slip."
"Tiki delivers fast, ears are good, ears are very smooth."
"Headsets are good, big basins. It's the same deal as the ones in the picture."
"Send the package on time, pack it carefully, fit the bag, loudspeaker, and the quality takes a while to find out..."
I've got it. I've got it. I've got it. I've got it. I've got it.
It's a beautiful machine with a flashlight that's connected to Bluetooth.
Loud sounds
"The battery's down, the signal's down, the rest's OK."
It's a kind of delivery. I don't think we can use that kind of radio.
"We can't get a radio, we can only hear it through memory cards."
I'm sorry the product didn't have the right color. It's not the right color. I'm disappointed.
Wrong delivery of the order.
"Hanging a goat's head selling meat, you're gonna get what's coming to you."
The product's okay.
good product
"() Uncalculation doesn't count the station's score without a GSM, just a wire."
"The delivery is consistent with the advertising description from the shop. The connection product is very stable, listening to warm music & loud, clear. The sound is good, against good noise. The design is pretty sharp, the color is sharp, the package is carefully packed, and the high quality, the quality, the purchase from FMCA should always rest assured of the quality and services from the firm."
"- Take this piece of headphones in your hand and have it all the time. - Design that you can hear, enough earplugs. (S,M,L) - Connection is stable. - sounds very smooth and smooth."
Very pleased!!
I don't know.
The package received a full box.
"Let's say that Tiki delivers fast, packaged goods, friendly delivery workers."
"● FERIAAAAA7 listening to Bluetooth True Wireless A7 - Tais listens to the AVA: ● FERNAAAA7 style of earbud-inear combined with the mattress at 3 S/M/L sizes with soft silicon material. The handle fits into the ear, does not cause pain, does not cause long - term wear. ● FIDS have a very strong magnetic magnet. ● The white film is very high, white, and is not caught in the dust or fingerprint. ● Sound is well used in sound, and is not broken, I feel the sound on my ear. ● A7."
"It's so high, you should buy it."
The quad is late compared to the appointment schedule.
Okay. Right stuff.
I'm hearing that there's a very expensive side to be bought.
Could not connect to Android and the iPhone to a fixed kreg
"The delivery on April 10, 24, the product that failed to be charged, there were four lights on and off, so I didn't notice."
"Styles, beautiful colors, light, thin, very kind, should buy, will support."
It's a good idea.
It's all right.
Nice stuff!
"It's like when you get paid to buy another girl, g402."
Newly used. Okay.
Good.
"Good earphones, very soft microphones, it's really good music, it's smooth call, the rubber button should be quite comfortable, the suit should have 2 size headsets for change, it's very easy to connect, it's really soft, if it's weak, it's delay 360 seconds, and normally, it's nice to dig, it's very expensive."
"The good stuff, the smoothing of ears, the fine connection range around the house, the long-term battery, opens up the box, it's self-connected. The touch button is the wrong button that pauses the song."
"Nice home hearing ear, fashion style, very comfortable wear, brand new seals are very secure, charge c very fast full of electricity, convenience, charge boxes are pretty good at power, headsets are excellent at the price."
"Your ear is so beautiful, your ears are so small, your ears are so small, your shop has a button that's very perchable, you wear it, you don't always have a headache, you hear three-and-a-half sounds so comfortable, your battery is very easy to connect, you're kind of technish, you're going to be able to use it all the time, you're not going to ask, it's very reliable."
"I'm going to buy more shop support, I'm going to buy all sorts of earpieces from the store, I'm going to show my friends the store, I'm going to have to have a lot of this cheap, I'm going to get this quality for everyone to use, thank you for the store, I'm going to have a boom shop."
"The hearing ear is very good at the price, the sound effect is good, the street sounds are very fine, you know, you charge type c quickly, you listen to music or you work well, your hearing ear meets your personal needs, you know, and you've got to pay for it."
The earpiece is very expensive. It's very comfortable. It's good music.
"Beautiful earpieces, smooth wear, brand-new types of c generations are fast and handy, rubber pads are smooth, batteries are very easy to track, high-level seal primes can be used as very good gifts."
"I've heard sounds like that before, but it's a good thing that you don't know if you're going to last more than a year."
"Good quality, good noise."
"It's the right product. It's published, it's good sound, it's good sound, it's good money, it's good money, it's good to buy it. It's good to use it."
"It's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good."
"It's nice, it's good, it's good, it's nice, it's good, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's good, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's good."
"It sounds good, but I don't know how many hours it's gonna be, because it's a big PKCB speaker hearing or should've put together these headsets, packaged well, delivered five."
"The only difference is that the sensors in the ear are so sensitive that when you're listening, you're going to be playing."
"The quick delivery, the sandy corals, the skin buys them, the whips they buy, the yen talent"
There's still a lot of batteries in there.
"Good sound, in particular, is a very long-term connection, a battery, very satisfied with the quality and price of the product."
"Good luck, good luck, very nice life, lots earphones are very good."
"Right product rewew, good quality"
"It's amazing, to be honest."
"Fast and thorough delivery, clear sound, if the shape is small, is even more wonderful."
Okay.
"Good sound, fast connection with smartphone and laptop."
"Too good for this kind of price, it's going to suggest that your friends buy it."
"The donor will buy more, settle down at this price."
"Good sound, easy connection."
That's nice or great.
It's been a long time since the cost of four.
"Listen to good music, should buy to use"
It's better than I expected.
"Listens to the best music, each battery's a little fast."
Quality fine cave
Good at price range.
It's pretty good. It's pretty good.
Very Good
"That's great, guys."
TERRIA

Okay.
"Sound quality is fine, complete. OK, quick delivery is well packed, but once a full headset from 100% to 30%."
"At first, we saw a nice, fast delivery, but after two days of not being as good as advertising, 100 percent full of batteries, but only 30 minutes of hearing the left ear ""Power Low"", and then I didn't know how many more minutes of hearing in the right ear, about five meters from the phone, and the sound was unstable, over the wall, and there was no sound in the house."
The charge's down. The battery doesn't have a battery.
"Not satisfied, the right ear is not working."
"It's a nice, tiny, soundable pattern, but users are a little bit slower than the original sounds."
"I'm having a hearing problem, but I can't get a text message from you, so please check your text for me."
"Bad hearing, very small hearing, irreplaceable, unreachable listening to a store, no response, no hope, no money."
"The product quality's bad, the five-day exchange is bad, the problem's bad, generally too bad."
Good.
Just got a package that's broken open for glue.
"The lady bought it, she broke the pin."
"I can't understand it, I can hear it, I can't hear it, I can't use it, I can't understand it, I can't hear it, I can't hear it, I can't hear it, I can't hear it."
"I can only hear one ear, the other one can't hear."
"Using ddc2 months, it's too dangerous to blow up."
Wearing too much ear pain.
"Good sound quality, easy connection"
"It's all right with audio products, voice mics."
It's the best sound to buy airpods.
"Okay, it's just a bit of a slice when you play the video yourself."
The left ear doesn't work.
"There's no battery, no ear."
The battery's been weak for only two hours.
It's nice to catch your eyes. It's very clear.
Good.
Good.
"I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, but I'm sorry."
"I've just turned on a little audio loudspeaker (I buy a five-watt speaker every time I open a loud, loud open newspaper), sound in spite of not as strong as my five-watt speaker but not as corny, with no noise, no standard quality, nothing to complain about, to turn it all the way down to the dark (unsy) bass, the handle is also lighter than I thought, the size, the purchase of money, the length of the machine, the length of the hand."
"Great speakers, not too good, but at this price range it's hard to find anything better, sustainable quality, or, uh, gentle consulting shop, well-packed, fast delivery."
I'll buy it for you. I'll do it for you. I'll do it for you.
"You know, it's pretty good. You know, it's pretty good. You know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you're pretty good, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you're pretty much cheap for speaker quality, so you don't ask for five more stars."
"I got it from the shop, it's really good, it's cheap, it's OK, I'm happy with the speakers."
"Well, that's a pretty good quality for a price. A stable connection is unscramble. Good support officer. Good job."
"I'm sorry, boss. I'm sorry to bother you, boss. I'm sorry to bother you, but I'm sorry to bother you, but I'm sorry to bother you so much, um, um, um, you know, um, you know, I'm just a little bit more than welcome to the shop, you know, maybe you'll be supportive."
"It's a cheap speaker. It's okay. It's good for the music, or it's not shy, or anything."
The loud speaker doesn't have the shyness I ordered for two days is generally too good at the price of shop five.
"Good product, beautiful model, sounds very good."
"That's a great speaker, cheap stuff that's high quality store. A funny shipper, kkk."
"Yeah, it's a stereo. It's like a bass. It's a nice, warm, nice shop. Okay, let's make it a little more headset."
The package is very carefully packed. The whole package is filled with enough sound quality. It's a beautiful design. It's quite impressive. It's used in general.
"It's just a 100-year-old speaker. It's not a scratch! Listen to the music, it's not good music, it's not good because bass can't hit much, it's not cheap, it's good."
So the quality doesn't require much. It sounds pretty good. It doesn't have anything to talk about.
"Yeah, well, that's a great speaker. It's a good sound. It's a good deal. It's a good sound."
"We just got the package, and it's cool, so we can judge the shop, it's really good, it's big, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's a big bass."
It's good for cheap. So I think this speaker's pretty good. It's kind of warm.
It's pretty smooth. The price is soft. It's got a nice little voice with a cable attached to it. It's okay.
"I got it from the shop. I got it for the first time. It's good. It's good. It's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good."
"It's easy to use loud, clean, cheap speakers. Thanks, number."
"The simple speaker turns on the connection. It's not that loud. It's not that great, but at the price, it's very reasonable."
"Good goods, pre-support stores, and after an enthusiastic purchase of goods, easy to use, easy to connect the wife of the shop, very safe to use, fun to buy more."
Sounds good.
The store's all right. I just got it so good. Okay.
"If it's cheap, then there's nothing to look down on."
"It's a good shop, it sounds good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good."
I appreciate the sound design. I've only heard eight-tenths of the battery before.
"Fast shopping shop, secure package, nice stereo, bass's pretty good within the price range."
The microphone sounds great. There's nothing to talk about. Everything's stable.
"It sounds good, guys. Okay. It's all good."
"Good speaker, excellent quality, steady hand grip, happy quick delivery shipper"
"It's a little baby, but it's so loud, it's so good, it's online, it's so good, it's got to wait for a 5-star shop."
"The low-cost speaker's fine at a price size, and it's a small one, and it's a good one."
"If you're small, you don't sound too loud, you don't get cheap, so I don't ask for more."
It's beautiful. It's good. It's good.
It's a good speaker. It's a big volume. It's very sustainable.
It's so good that I always buy it. It's so cool.
"Nice speaker, neat design, safe box."
"It's a nice speaker. Thanks, thanks, thanks."
It's very nice. It's very light and easy to use.
"Nice blueback speaker, delighted consulting shop."
"audio player. Okay, enough."

The delivery is exactly the same as the ad. OK.
Okay.
"The quality is temporary, sometimes I don't get it, and I buy it to hook up my hearing, because it's too short, and the rope's too short, so I get it right away, and this is when I don't get it, and I have to change my head many times."
"Can't hear, can't hear, can't hear."
"You buy a pair of heads and you hand over whatever rope you don't know, you give it back, or you pay for it."

It's good.
"Fast delivery, quality product, sure, it's hard to break down, especially neat to get rid of the backpack wherever you can use it."
"The delivery at HCM was a little late, but the delivery was very fine, it didn't help waiting, it was very small, it was neat, it was light and it was very hard to build, it was very good work, it was great."
"Well, at first, I didn't notice that it's the Macbook, but I don't think it's strong enough to raise a five-pounder, which tells you that men should buy pink to show their manhood as well as their level."
"As soon as I got the product today, it's a pretty neat product, and I think it's pretty sure it won't break with both hands on top at a price, and I think it makes sense that you have a laptop so you don't get too hot or you don't get a scratch on it."
"But if the angle angle of the angle can make different angles, and the handle is good, now there's only one angle angle, and it's a little steep in personal opinion."
"The product is fairly certain, the height is not suitable, it's not very good; it's cool; Tiki is nice, sure, fast delivery; there's two things I want to do to get Tiki to change the user's friendly interface: 1. Make more like buttons right where the product is, not two new operations can be added to the favorite basket; two. The combination of choosing to buy a few products in the cart rather than to buy the whole thing as it is today, every time and time it takes time."
"The cover of Tiki's three layers and two layers of the inside of the product, very carefully, the height also makes sense, is very pleased with the product despite the long-term delivery of the disease."
"The aluminum product is so sure, it's impossible to use normally, since it's an eye-higher neck that it doesn't have to bend down when you type or use a laptop, and people who sit on their computers should buy it to protect their necks for a long time."
"- Good materials, acceptable prices. I bought two, I got freeships, I brought them along, I didn't know them at first, so the computer looked high, but now it's normal -- well-groomed, fast-transported -- incredibly pleased."
"It's so beautiful, it's high-end aluminum."
"Quick delivery, convenient use."
"You should buy this in bed, you should only use the machine from 14 inches down."
That's great.
"The price is a little high for the products of the same function, but the code and endurance make you quite pleased with the product, looking quite elegant and sure."
"Intriguingly, the material with elaborate color, especially aesthetics, the rounding of the corners and the rubber pads is fine."
There's a few words about looking at the product.
"After a long, painful day at the back, this girl is a reasonable choice. It's just as high as she can see, it's very comfortable and it's very sure."
"The deal was too fast, the night before we got it the next morning, and the price was sure, by the time the list was right, 10 points of tiki's dv."
"That's a really good quality -- hard cable, right angle -- there's a silicon pad, so don't worry about the product satisfaction machine -- so let's put the 3 kilogram computer up as sure as trade."
"Simple, simple design, but sure."
"The solid, solid solid solid solidity doesn't shake when you type a laptop, the color is slightly brighter than the image."
"The package is well packed, the paper box is intact when delivers it is small but sure, the color is beautiful, the customer is very pleased to receive the product and is pleased to use it. 10 points for quality."
"I've just bought the product, and I'm very pleased with the quality, but the aluminum rack looks a little better in the picture, and it's also more direct, although it's not very familiar, and Tiki's package is very careful, and she's very friendly, and she's very happy with Tiki, and she's very supportive of the shop."
"Very pleased with this product -- light, neat, perfect design."
"Two-hour delivery, very pleased from the nice clean, unscramble box closing, the right set, the product doesn't scratch, the nice color, the firm hand holding!"
"So buy it for me. I'm a cheap sale, and I'm a cool caver."
Medical Quality Quality
"It's very satisfying, it's nice, it's just like Tiki introduced, and people should buy this, and they'll also support the heating of the laptop, and they'll raise it to the right level of sight, and they'll give it to you."
"I've bought two shelves of this store, but I prefer this one to please you on the quality of the product: - Jacob's quite thorough - surely (my laptop is nearly 3 kilograms) to be sure) - There's a rubber pad that doesn't get wiped on the machine. ok adjust the altitude"
"The price was solid and thin, and Tiki delivered it quickly and on time."
"The product doesn't feel anything, doesn't pack, doesn't have anything to say about it."
"Take care of the package, the nice ones."
"The product's OK, but it's been off the rubber for a while."
"It's not the right idea but it's good at perfecting, packing well, sure and looking very nice to the table."
"It's hard, it's hard, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good."
"It's pretty good though there's a little bit of movement going around if the user changes the point of view to the machine, and it's definitely not the same as, you know, you let the pro 15 inches look good."
"- Fast transport, good materials, reasonable prices, easy to carry."
"It's always been an approved product like this. <i>- Good quality is strong, it's delicately cut - it's easy to change the angle - There's silicon at every contact point with the macbook so it's very reassuring.</i> <i> Tiki delivered quite quickly.</i>"
"The package is exactly the way it's going, sure, the slope is just right, so it's very comfortable on the machine."
"It's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good."
The beautiful product is the right pattern.
"It's a nice color, it's good for the price."
"Quality, Hard"
"I kind of love this product - utility: it's easy to fold to take it with me if you go to the coffee shop and do your job - Design: beauty, silver and a rubber/silon base that doesn't fail."
"Small, easy to use, convenient, reasonable prices."
"It's a perfect match for a 16-year-old Macbook who bought 100 bottles, got a nightcap, and didn't have any fear of a scratch. God, I didn't know what to write, but I also told you that the content has to be at least 50 letters, and that's whether or not to make a comment."
"It's beautiful, it's sure, it's the same color as macbook, it's the same color as Tiki delivers fast and nice!"

Good.
"Sp sure, nice"
"The overall product is worth the price, but it's only a height and a steady slope, so it's a little uncomfortable."
"I'm not trying to write but I'm going to make DV a little bit better. i'm going to buy two things, but I'm going to pick this for yellow because it's not worth much more than the pink one, but I'm going to get the pink one, and then I'm going to talk to KHI, and I'm going to exchange it before I make the decision and I'm going to do it at the official price of SP."
"So the customers were wondering if this is the product's goods, but it's more than 269k 'cause they think there's a Hezbollah name."
Shop doesn't support the rush of Tiki's delivery but just dumps all of Tiki and tell herself to hurry:
"The product looks good in color, the material is solid, but if the supplier so that there can be multiple hiccups that adjust the tilt of the base, it's more convenient for the user."
"Beauty colors look certain, however unable to adjust slope"
"Beautiful product, carefully packed."
"The delivery was on schedule, and the contact with a laptop had soft rubber, so it was avoided a scratch."
"It's pretty good, so the sale is pretty high for the product, so thank you tiki for the quick delivery price."
It's a little low.
"The product's fine, the price's a little high."
"It's a beautiful product, sure, but the translation should take a long time."
"Beautiful, sure, very well suited to his computer the aluminum frame is sure"
Good back-up shop. Make sure to use it.
The limit point is that there aren't as many hiccups to adjust altitude as some other products.
"All right, what's the point of not knowing what to write for?"
"It's good, it's tough, it's silky. It's a little small for a 15-inch cc."
"It's neat, it's solid, it's hard, it's fast, it's repetitive, and it's brought with it. It's a product of a variety of laptops, macbooks, or tablet."
"Surely, it is useful to use it!"
"It's okay. It's pretty solid, but it doesn't adjust the altitude."
It's a tough little product.
"It's pretty good to use, but there's only one step. If you make it into two places to change altitude, it's going to be OK."
"The foot for the machine is pretty weak, so if the table doesn't have space, it's a little uncomfortable, but the product's burd is pretty sure."
"The onions are pretty fast, the shiper attitude is 10 points."
good use
"It's a little small in the horizontal, it's better to increase by about two centimeters."
It's so high that it's hard to use.
I'm not ready to review the quality yet.
It's a broken state after two days.
The list is too small to fit the laptop to carry too much
"I like the price that can go up and down and down a little bit, and this one's good, and it's no big deal."
"There's no changing the level of vacbook support, but the product is definitely the right price."
It's a little researched over and over a little bit.
It's normal. It's nothing.
"I can't adjust the resistance, watch this kind of thing."
"All right, K's too good, he's good, he's good, he's good, he's good, he's good, he's good, he's good, he's good, he's good, he's good, he's good, he's good, he's good, he's good, he's good, he's good, he's good, he's good, he's good, he's good, he's good, he's good, he's good."
Okay.
The Xps line Dell doesn't buy it because it's down the toilet player.
Okay.
It's a normal perfection. It's just a very high step. It's not very good.
"The product is solid, but it's easy to slide."
"It's slippery, it's not good to stay on the line."
"It's nice and sharp, and then it doesn't fit with big latops."
The price is definitely as beautiful as the picture.
Okay.
"The product's model, quality's good, thick, hard-wired, good-powered design."

"Light price, good materials, and very sure stuff, friendly tiki delivery."

& Tools
The two joints are still loose. The blue is pale and the orange is dark. It's not like the shape.
"The beauty card, memory card, and street colors are just fine, generous, for the required accessories, for the design of thick, fixed pads, and for the protection of good access, and for the use of daily conveniences!"
"Light, Convenient"
"It's nice, it's thick, it's good luck."
"Close your package carefully. The full package should be included (because you're sweating) <i>For the first time, you don't have a lot of feedback.</i> <i>It's a bit of a shake.</i> <i>I don't know.</i> <i>I don't have the first time.</i> <i>I don't have too much of a drawing.</i> <i>I don't have too many notes.</i> <i>You don't have to draw the right corner.</i> <i>If I have to draw it, then I don't have to draw it.</i>"
"It's my first touch of an electronic table, so I don't know what to compare with all the others."
"I'm not a professional, and I've never used a drawing board before, so I can't think clearly about it."
"Packages come in sooner than expected for three days, packed thoroughly. The device is also easy to install. The device is easy to load up, and then the keyboard is simple, the pen is custom, it's easy to use. This is the same price for new people like you.hi."
"The good product, the low cost, the bigger that I thought, and the special delivery was pretty fast, and I love this drawing board, and I'm trying to draw on the phone for the first time, and it's a little bit harder, but then I got to get used to it, but it's all Chinese, so I have to go online and ask how to connect (it's going to be harder for you to use computers to draw if you don't know Chinese)."
"I've been trying to get this one to fit in my pocket, and I've been getting used to it for a few days, and I don't know how long it's going to last."
"I'm not much of a drawer, because I'm not an artist, and I don't have any experience with drawing boards, so there's no high demand for drawing boards."
I got it yesterday. 24/2 at first I was worried about buying sp. I got it online.
"It's good, but it's all Chinese."
"Be careful with the package, quick delivery."
I just got the package. I don't think it's that big. It's okay. I haven't used it yet.
"The line is very good, the delivery is right, the pen is sensitive the buttons use quite well the price. I tried to use it in drawing, I didn't get used to it at first, but it's pretty simple here is a product of my own on the drawing board."
"I can use it on the phone, and when I don't get it, I'm afraid the phone won't go to the mouse, but I'm glad it didn't happen."
"It's only been a couple of days since the experience of teaching students onlie to feel a good feedback from students, which is a long-term girl, OK, I don't know how long it's been."
It's brilliant. It'll cost you a lot of money. Okay.
"The low-cost drawing table that's good, easy to use, but it's a little big in size, and people can consider it before they buy it."
"At first, I didn't think it was any bigger than a computer, but suddenly, I didn't know how to use it at first, but when I did, it was very good to describe it."
"Pack it up, deliver it 20 days earlier, have a full replacement pen, just download it as well."
"- It's a long time before the delivery, but it's still two days early with deadline. - The back of the box is a little rusty. - The key is loud, it's not smooth. ---The quality of the board and the pen, and the amount of writing, it feels like it's on paper."
"I'm lazy, so I don't need to install a little bit cheaper than wacom, which is equal to the price, and then I don't know which drawing panel is better than that."
"After a week of use, I found this drawing panel to be very nice, and you bought it because it's very soft, and it's very smooth, and like the others say, the sound of the button is going to be loud, but I'm not going to make a sound, so if it's really a mistake, I don't know whether it's going to be fun or sad, the product of the shop is very reliable."
"The delivery's three days early, packed thoroughly, Sp looks fine."
"The big drawing board, the big drawing area, looks pretty nice, it's smooth, it's easy to re-install it again. It's a little rough on the canvas, it's kind of slippery."
"Close it carefully, it's nice, it's really pretty, it looks pretty good, it's pretty complicated, I don't have a lot of experience, so I don't appreciate how much it's going to work for you."
"The complete drawing table, which has been used for nearly three weeks, is very smooth."
"The drawing board is fine, you get super fast, you get the next day, you don't get used to it at first, but you'll get used to it for a while."
"It's okay, the shop's excited about how to use it."
"It's fully functional, subsidy, but when you get the box that's a bit distorted and incomplete, you don't know whether it's time for storage or transportation, but it's okay not to damage the product, you still understand, the best drawing table at a price has nothing to ask for too much."
"Well, that's stable, folks, but for those online teachers this season, it's great for the product, but if you have a small space, you should buy a smaller size."
"I don't think it's that big, it's just a box pound, it's not installed, it's all Chinese yet."
"The product's good. I bought two more for the gift, and everyone loved it."
"The good stuff, the screen's pretty big, so it's kind of seating, and sometimes it's hard to move, and on the phone, it's not machine-based, it's not visible on the horizontal screen, and on the computer, it's delicious."
"The big table, the sensor, the cost! plug it in, and if you want to adjust the button, then you have to install a pt. Gaomon (the uncles who go up to your gg search sound), but the sound of reading doesn't make any sense. This buy is quite impressive. At first, it's just a lie. But when you try it, it's up to 8191."
"The package's distorted, but the package's fine."
"The drawing board is really good, and the drawing table is bigger than I thought, but it's a lot better, and I'm just wondering that these days that I've been using the drawing board, and it's a little slow and big, and I've got to press the pen twice, and I've got to go to Gaomon's Driver's Driver's Driver, and I've got to ask if that's normal."
"Screen, full accessories, good cover, easy to use"
"I've tried, very well OK compared to the price of the money, but according to the description there'll be two converts, I've only received one head convert to USB type C. May the supplier/tiki check the order."
"It's very satisfying, the table is very sensitive, and it's very easy to install with the delivery four days earlier than it is."
"Fast delivery, second order order received, satisfied with the quality of the product, well-suited in teaching, online learning, appropriate prices."
I just got a pretty fast delivery. 20 picked up the package. It took me three days to get a package. It's a brand-new package.
"It's very sensitive, you can write it with a pin, but you don't know how to use it because it's all in Chinese."
"Ship is extremely fast, the product is full, holding your hands quite gently (not as big as you think), and in short, it's extremely high, so buy it."
"receive the full product as I see it, still in the process of finding out how to use it."
"The only subtraction point is that the minib plug-in head is a little tight, and it's hard to take off, but that price is okay, and it's going to continue to support the shop if this product lasts a long time."
It's good to buy.
The product ok full package accessories carefully
This is the first time I've ever used a drawing board. It's very easy to use the 8192 pressure. It's very high.
"And after a few days of experience, I felt really good at the price. And it's pretty good to write it, it's easy to install the iTunes."
"I'm going to find out later. I'm going to borrow, I'm going to use my own gate, I'm going to use my xiami Redmi 8 is very smooth, I'm going to use it on my computer, I'm going to use it for five stars."
Fine.
"It's a nice machine, it's a pretty fast delivery time, it's not broken."
"It's OK, but it takes more than a day to get used to it."
"The good stuff is definitely smooth, the package is careful, the delivery is faster than expected."
"The product was delivered about four days earlier, and the box was just a little distorted, but the product wasn't damaged."
"The delivery was faster than expected at first, after opening the box full of devices such as ads."
"Quick delivery, enough equipment, good use."
"Ok, the delivery is earlier than expected, the package is exactly what it looks like."
"Perfect at price range, perfect quality of shells, high sensitivity."
"It's all right, it's all right, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good."
"Great quality. Quick delivery. Put the next one in half, but I'm not connected to the phone."
"It's the first time I've used it to draw, so I don't know anything about tissues, but ns generally is good."
"It's pretty smooth, except there's no manual, no one in the middle language understands all the work!"
"It's extremely satisfying, fast delivery, good product, well packed."
Good stuff.
"Front-end delivery one, very well-used product."
It's the right model. It's very good.
It's good to be used so fast. I'm good to go. I'm good to go. I'm good to go.
"Fast delivery used during translation season. A nice and good machine, but you're not used to drawing pads, so it's hard to move too fast."
"S.P.P.'s good with the package, but it's a little late for the delivery, but it's why the fluids are so understanding."
"The quality table is fine, the price is right, if it's written properly, it doesn't make any difference to what a regular pen is."
"The delivery is two days early. Use okie. Drive is easy to install but full of Chinese. big tablefaces, light pens, change pens."
"I didn't read it carefully, so I bought the board for one connection."
It's pretty good.
It's been spent for over a year. It's okay now.

"We've got the right product, we've got the goods in the middle of the season, we haven't used them yet, so we don't have an sp assessment."
"I just got the package today, and there's a kilogram on themon Page about putting it on my computer, but I can't even try two computers, and I can't even shoot the shop, and I can't answer it, and I'm really disappointed."
"After two weeks of use and acquaintance, you have to make the following observation. The point is: - The drawing table uses fine - The brush is smooth, short is cut, short - many buttons for shortcut - low prices: - The click of the pen is not sensitive. You have to use a lot of force to pick up the stroke. The light line to clearness is good, but when the sharpness of your hand is not to change it, it's not so light that it's so light that it's so light that it's so light that it's dark? - When you lift the pens up when it's not sensitive, it's short that you have to use the middle mouse button, you have to find the same coloring button on it. - You have to use it, you have to use it's the same way before you have to use it."
"I got the pen and the drawing board on time, but I didn't see the spare pen, and the board didn't have a pen for the introduction."
The first move is faster than expected.
"If you don't use it, you can go to YouTube and look for instructions and see that you're giving me more than 600K, but you've got your Micro USB player to connect the phone, and now you've got this access shop, and you're going to try it and then you're going to try it again."
"I'm just trying on the phone, and I'm cool, and I've got access to all the parts I've just bought, so I'm going to go for a little bit of my computer, and I'm going to thank you for this because the delivery is a little bit of a long time ago."
"Take the package earlier than expected, pack it simply, make it whole, work smooth, thank you Shop and Tiki, hope the product is sustainable!"
"The beauty drawing board, three days early for delivery, is like the left mouse replacement, but it's kind of hard to get used to because of how the mouse moves are moving. The problem is that when you use Onenote 16 on win7, as you press left mouse, the scan cursor selects and for different operations."
I can't write for a few minutes because the natural table can't connect with the computer I'm trying with other computers.
The drawing panel could not connect the computer. This is already installed from the manufacturer (tryed on 3 different computers).
"If you use this table with an ax phone, you can use it if you want to turn on the OTG connection on your phone, you can use it forever, you can't even think of returning the goods."
"It's more than 700 times the next day. <i>Sale?</i> <i>A bigger price, bigger than you can imagine.</i> <i>Even if you look at other sites, it'll include gloves and screens and warrants, but still buy Tiki for believing?</i> <i>I know it's better to buy somewhere else.</i> <i>I don't know.</i> <i>I don't know.</i> <i>It's good to buy somewhere else.</i>"
"When I first bought it, I put it on my lap. OK. But now I'm going to switch to the machine and then I'm going to zoom in, and then I'm going to roll the mouse, and it's not going to work. How can I fix this?"
"I don't know if it's a problem, but they're too long."
"I can't use it, but I don't know who to ask."
"The drawing board is very smooth, it's written well, it's packed carefully, it's delivered for a week, but it's not measured because it's just bought."
"Too bad, you can't connect even if you have an Otg, you can't try another machine."
"It's okay, it's good, it's press, it's smooth, it's priced, it's either one error, it's missing connection, it's fully installed, it's just a few minutes away from the computer, it's got to be unplugged."
No manual to use and install.
"It's pretty good, but you shouldn't have bought it for drawing. It's not very smooth. It's not very convenient."
Why don't we plug in the antlers and not notice the pens?
The drawing panel is an error. The shop reports but the shop does not support much. Texting the shop does not respond.
"The package is too low, it's a boxed delivery. It's still good for good luck."
"I just bought three days and suddenly saw the notice of disconnected quieid pen, writing still feels like the head's moving but nothing at all (like the plain pen), so let me ask you, what's the error?"
"The quality of appearance is good, but the cable is not available, and using a different cable of the same kind can be connected to the computer. The experience of writing, drawing very well, operating almost without delay."
"No delivery received yet, but shipper reported a successful delivery of the payment product first and expected the store to return to help"
"Got the package exactly the way it looks, tried the pen to feel like it was real."

"It's pretty good on the computer or on the phone, but from the description it's possible to get on the screen, why don't I see it?"
"It's hard to use, it's all Chinese, it's not as sensitive as advertising."
"I'm getting something fast, but I'm not connected to the computer, so let me get some advice."
Can't write a shop.
"It's Chinese for an hour, but they say it's good."
"The machine's easy to use -- it's very satisfying -- but compared to the price of the shit, it's a little bit of a regret-dot-four star difference."
"We're missing the USBsang microdoor for Android. Oh, my God, it's okay."
"It's ok! And the package is solid, deliver on the day and match the description!"
"It's all china, it's hard to use."
"When the pen is stuck for a week, the pen is stuck, the pen is still drawn, the pen is stuck, instead of it, it takes time to call tiki."
"The delivery's sooner than planned, good, smooth, but there's some places I don't know how to use like where the buttons are on the left and what's the flash drive's head for?"
Driver the non-installed version has to use the older version. What's the problem?
"There's a little scratch on the board, it's too sensitive to correct."
"It's a little slow and it's not very smooth, but at a cost of over 600k, it's okay."
"I've got the drawing board this afternoon, and I haven't had time to shut it down yet, but I noticed that I didn't have a spare pen with me, so let's hope tiki answers soon."
"When you're buying a cable connection, you're completely connected to the plug-in leg. This error has been preserved."
"We can't connect the board with Android. Even if the machine updates 6.0, what do we do?"
"It's a little bit of a phone connection, but it's a really good drawing board."
"It's a good time to deliver the good stuff. Okay, it's worth it."
I've lost the connection.
"It's smooth, but it's been a while."
Shop should have more detailed instructions.
"Shop, please. Let me get in touch with you for a second."
"Pack your bags carefully, no use, wait noen"
"According to the description, this table has an Icd screen that doesn't show anything?"
"The drawing board was good, but I was wondering why I didn't touch anything when I first bought it, but it had some scratch on the board?"

"Need to return, quality air, failed"
Why isn't there a pen instead?
"Driver can't install, it's all in Chinese."
I'm not happy with the delivery.
Why did you put it on the phone without a mouse so you could draw? I can't draw.

A nice-looking camera pull-up.
Quick delivery.
"Dude, maybe during some misdirection, we're 11 pros, we can't do this, we can't change it."
"Oh, yeah, but the ghost of his camera bag is loose, so he's got a four-star store."
"It's quite complete, pretty hard press, and the white-grassed plastic cover has to be cut out, the camera cap is convenient."
The roof of the back has folds if they're crushed.
"It's beautiful, but it's a bit expensive!"
The quality's pretty bad.
It's okay.
Okay.
Normal
"The delivery is quick, well-packed, back colored as if it were a post."
"The first time you buy things on tiki, everything is good, you deliver them super fast, they're going to be back for the shop next time, you should buy them."
"I'm sure the back is thick with dark glasses, so I can stick up the stickers, and I can do whatever I want, and the slide protects the camera, and the package is packed, and the delivery is too tight, but it's a little too tight to unplug the other one, and it's a little too hard to unplug the other."
Quality product.
"- Okay, shop."
"You buy it and put it in the trash, how do I evaluate it?"
"Bad quality, too much glue, bad back, under one star."
"It's a little dusty when you open it, and you have to clean it up, and it's kind of strange with a camera cap, and it's light, and it's not so heavy."
"It's very hugged, the edge should hold tight. The camera's a little heavy-handed."
"A piece of glue on the base, with no hands on it, really pissed off!"
Okay.
It's a bad back quality. It's been torn.
"Close to the machine, good plastic."
Op broke right at the camera.
"The lid wasn't sure, it was loose, so it slipped out, and it was meant to protect the camera, and the lid got out."
The picture's just for the coin because it's installed and then it's not removed.
Okay.
It's a scratch that doesn't look new at the price of the store's attention.
"Oh, okay."

"First, I felt extremely bad about the package and delivery of tiki, which took me four weeks to get the goods."
"I've been using the product for a few months, but if you use it for a long time, it's gonna hurt your ears."
The delivery's a week late.
"The package is good, the delivery is on time, but because of the effects of the nCV I have to work at home and call tiki Saturday night to support the receiving site, you press to check if I can't get support, but then I don't see any more reports."
"Thanks, it's pretty good. It takes time to figure out how long it takes."
"The ear can hear it, the microphone can't hear it. Ask the dealer to check it for you."
"Let me ask you, is this earpiece compatible with the MAC machine, thank you."
Amb doesn't sound right.
"The delivery is quick, packed carefully, the product is well heard."
Okay.
Anker is not a table......but tiki is not an object.
Quick pour of good package quality
"It's a quick, less hot battery."
"Satisfy, shallowly"
Good.
Good.
"Tiki gave the wrong delivery but refused to deal with the customers, and I put in an adare charge of Anker 45W, but when I received the package and opened the box, it was the other one, which was used and very old, although the video was open to the end and the image was full but Tiki didn't solve all the responsibility and risk for the client, returned the box and adadrelling the other one to the wrong place, I think people should choose to be safe and secure for themselves in Tiki's more than Tiki."
"It's good, but after buying it, we'll know that the store is worth almost twice as much as the other place."
"Got it from a good package shop, got it tight, protected oranges..."
Good server shop.
"Just got the goods from the shop, the cars are tight to the machine, protecting the oranges. Simple, for shop five."
It's extremely satisfying.
Fits into luck.
"It's bad, it's so scratchy. 45k doesn't want anything in return."
It's OK. We can use it for a long time. We don't know for five stars.
Type C can be used. The days are down.
"I've bought two of these, but I've got no name for using them, but I don't like them because they're loosely turned, and they're very pleased because they're very good, and they're twice as high, but they're worth it."
"The product's fine at the point of the price, holding tight, the price's inexcusable, and the rest has nothing to complain about."
"The product is sure, like the description."
"Fast, punctual delivery, carefully packed, held-holding product, caught it in the engine leg, and got a good phone clip."
"The good product, pretty sure, the phone clamps look good, generally this product is worth buying."
"Fast travel, steady product, as nice as this one will continue to buy from the shop."
"There's plastic, there's nipples, there's turns, it's good, there's quality."

"The good stuff, but details of delivery need to be updated regularly so that the customers can keep track of the intestinal fever (the common mood of the buyer)."
I'm going to buy another Tripod spider's leg.
"The plastic column should touch his hands, if it's metal, it's more obvious."
"Okay, well, we're good at this. The plastic's a little bad, but the rubber pad is okay. For three stars, it's worth more than the other one I bought."
"You should buy them for use, so instead of buying them cheaply."
It's hard to put into a tripot.
"That's okay, folks. That's not 50 words."
Okay.
"It's okay, it's not sure, it's a little weak, it's a lot of price compared to quality."
"Tiki's packed up, and it's a little bit more expensive, but I hope it's a little bit more secure."
good product.
"The goods are wrapped up, the same shape is also given with a string which is very, very well tied to the product."

"The bag is not exactly the description, so I'm going to choose the two compartments that look like one, and I'm going to ask the shop to explain."
It's okay to see.)
It's very visual. It's all good.

"There are only so few compartments inside, there are strong, large, wide bags, there are cells to hold the camera batteries and cables."

Good rope.
Okay.
"Good, nice, tight."
Quality!
"I'm using this wire that's pretty loosely attached to the clock inside, and the strong movement can fall out, and it's like the unprincipled public goods, and the rubbers aren't as soft and as smooth as the company's own, so the rope's a little bit low, so the closing button is pretty loose, and the only point is that it's cheap to the floor."
"I put in Mi Band 3, but I don't think Mi Band Five's straps, so it doesn't fit very well, the color, the material is fine, the delivery is sooner than expected."
The high-priced product that looks pretty bad on the wire doesn't look good.
"It's cheap, it's fast, but it shouldn't be bought because: one, the rubber wire is just a lot of red, it's not as bad, it's not as sharp, it's not as sharp as two, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's not like, it's like, it's not like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, like, like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's not like, like, it's like, it's like, like, it's like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, it' it' it' it' it' it' it' it' it' it' it' it' it's like, it's like, it' it's like, it' it's like, it' it' it' it' it' it' it' it' it' it'"
Just about as hard as the wire is.
"It's really bad, it's not a zinc, it's really soft, and I can't keep my face down, and I've spent a couple of hours on my own."

Fine.

"As some of you have observed, the delay of the mouse is a little bit high, and it's often slow-moved, especially when you use a PCP mode, and with white mice, when you move the mouse, the red light turns out to be a little out of the aesthetic hole."
"I've got short-term rats, I've got to go back, I've got to turn them off, I've got to connect them, I've got to go back, I've got to go back, I've got to go back, I've got to open them, the computer hasn't turned off."
"Fast delivery, carefully packed. Mouse is exactly the same as the image, smooth, sensitive ones. They can be used on all surfaces because the mouse's lower surfaces have a prescribing layer. It's convenient to charge directly, not to remove the battery, but to use them for a while before we know it."

"The product uses OK, no noise, but sometimes it's not very sensitive."
"The rat connecting us is fine, but the phaser connection isn't good, the connection is about 10 minutes, it's stiff, it's not moving."
An error rat doesn't accept a computer.
"I've been on win 11 for a while, but what's wrong with that?"
"The smooth mouse, an inconvenience is to charge it through the web gate, which is probably about one and a half days in a row."
Rats are more than a month out.

Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
Okay.
It's good. It's good. It's good.
It's too much. It's all right. It's all right. It's all right.
"There's no signal attached to it. There's no signal, there's no trigger, there's a really bad customer support provider. Maybe I'll just buy tiki checkding on this trading floor."
I can't use it. I can't take it to Vinaphone's. I'm recommending a ktra shop.

"I bought it on July 10, sim. I got it for 24 days. For almost a month, I didn't know what the store was like."
"My orders: 251120-5000 I got a line from last week but this week I installed them for use but no 4G. The 4G symbol is still online, but there is no network."
"Sim ok, first of all, I thought sim's an error. <i>Skisch works in a smooth network.</i> <i>Gran's like a flash.</i> <i>I'm so sorry.</i> <i>I'm so sorry.</i> <i>I'm so sorry.</i> <i>I'm so sorry.</i> <i>I'm so sorry.</i> <i>I'm so sorry.</i> <i>I'm so sorry.</i> <i>I'm so sorry.</i> <i>I'm so sorry.</i> <i>I'm so sorry you'm so sorry.</i> <i>I'm so sorry.</i>I'm so sorry.</i>I'm so sorry.</i>I'm so sorry.</i> <i> <i> <i>I'm so sorry you'm so sorry.</i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i>I'm so sorry.</i> <i> <i>I'm so sorry.</i> <i> <i>I'm so sorry.</i>I'm sorry.</i> <i>I'm so sorry.</i>I'm so sorry.</i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i>I'm so sorry.</i>I'm so sorry.</i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i>I"
Thanks you store is very reliable and reliable.
"For the first time on tiki, long-term delivery..."
I'm sick of saying that sim is 12 months away from getting 8-9 months.
buys 20/20 and checks to see if it's six months old.
"buys four Gs on the off-line, contact numbers on a paper that can't be contacted."
"The sim is activated 15 days ago, but the quality is good."
Good product at a price range.
"The product is exactly what it looks like. It's pretty light, for those of you who like the bright red."
TERRIA
"I'm a little surprised at the cost of the good skin, aren't I, but I'm very happy right now?"
I've bought two hours of skin since I bought it. I've bought a genepad.
"The price was reasonable, and the skin was nice, and it looked sure, and it should be easy to use, but the inside of the bag was loose, and the use of two or three days was loose, but the cx kk didn't affect anything, and it was fine."
"It's only been a month since we bought it, tiki!"
Poor Quality Not to Buy
"Nothing special, but it fits the price."
It's not even two months since the rubber tape has been cut off.
"It's only been a month since I've spent it, and I've lost my skin."
"It's small, it's tiny, it's small, it's sound-free. There's no resonant casserole on either side."
"Good cover, hard look, good if there's more instructions."
"Buy the speaker with the microphone of the shop, the quality is very good, the mic sings soft, the stereo or the bass is fun and cool, the quality of the product is great."
It's a great sound speaker. It's a big sound. It's a warm bass. It's a sensitive Bluetooth.
"It's a great sound speaker, everyone. It's extremely good quality. 8 out of 10 points."
"Listen to this music, it's not always cool, it's really loud, it doesn't ring a bell, it's actually worth the money."
It's so much warmer outside than in the picture.
"Great speakers, brand-new packages, brand-new, fancy, buyin' two of these things which are very good and sustainable, very satisfying, and good luck selling goods for the customers."
"The sound sounds great, it's very good, it's very good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good."
Grandpa and his three-year-old nephew are playing sales.
"The bass pad, the bamboo is too good for sale, the amount of less suspicious, the amount of kung fu, is worth listening to personal music."
"Sounds good, gets computers, memory cards, quality speakers, sounds good, little loudspeakers, easy to use loudspeakers."
the large lyric speaker the kkkkk arm
"The speaker is stable, the loud sound is clear, the small size is easy to carry, the battery is stable for a long time, the bamboo and bass are balanced, the design is good."
"Sounds good, good quality of sound, easy to connect, good commercials are worth money."
"Slow delivery, bad delivery."
"Okay, with the center of the price."
Good sound sounds loud.
Tiki's delivery service is fine.
"Cara sounds warm and inside, price over 200k etc is too fine"
"It's fast, steady, it's loud, it's corny, it's worth it."
"Large volume speakers, Max sounds non-student, Tennis stable, bag speakers, compared to prices, okay, five stars."
"Nice quality of sound, nice style, very expensive."
"It's OK, it's good. It's better than the price. It's small, it's beautiful, it's loud, it's unsympathetic."
It sounds like 8/10. It's okay. It's a 5-star shop.
It's beautiful. It's OK. It's cheap.
"Okay, that sounds great."
High Quality
"Two days late, but the speaker is pretty good. Okay. It's too good to put another one in."
"That's great. Good sound buys the price of ale. So, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."

Okay.
"It's not a compliment, but I think it's quite the best style to buy."
That sounds great.
"Good sound quality, nice good delivery, quick delivery."
"Great speaker. Very simple quality, but beautiful. That's good."
"Cara sounds warm, or, automatically off if you stop using, there's a bad battery."
"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no."
"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
"The cave shop is fast, chats are changing the supply. Okay. Okay. To the 5-star shop."
The quality of your product is very pleased.
That's a great speaker. Good turn. Okay.
Good product.
the speaker or little button that is easy to connect Bluetooth is also far away generally very pleased
The speaker sounds good compared to the price.
Okay.
longst
Lao ok
"The speaker's pretty good at the price, very pleased."
I don't know.
It's good. It's good. It's good.
It's brilliant. It's good to buy. It's good to buy.
Sp ok
"After we bought the 18th of January, 2024, it's now August 15th, 2024, and we're hearing it's losing sound, and while we're connected, it's still connected, it's increasing, it's still possible, but when it's on, it's not playing."
"The black speaker delivered red, and then the five-hour charge didn't go bad, and before I bought electronics on tiki, I got the first number of times I got the crap."
"Yeah, it's pretty loud. It's like, you know, you're gonna have to pick up the blues, so you're gonna have to buy them at a price range."
"Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes."
I haven't heard that in days. It's not working.
There's no charge cable. I'd like to get a T.T.E.D. support.
"The connection is better, it's smaller in the picture, the sound's only going to match the price. It doesn't sound good."
I've bought it for a month. It's only been four or four times. It's ruined.
Sp can't use... Very sad.
"The sound's good, the delivery's fast, thepin hasn't lasted long."
Cx sound fine
"I'd like to change the speakers. I'd like to charge them all over the place for the night to run out of batteries, turn on the kilograms."
Listen to my bow.
We're two days away from buying the speaker.
Two days out. I can't hear you.
I can't hear you if you've just used it.
A two-day speaker.
Very good at 225K.
It's not exactly a commercial.
"It's pretty solid, but it's kind of web."
"Good, healthy battery, cute bag."
10 Points
Good headsets. Three days worth of ear cells for a 10-point shop.
"The new 100 percent hard-wired blue-phone connection that's so easy to connect to the computer Bluetooth, which is pretty warm -- super fast, less than a day's worth of goods."
The company's main offer is always cheaper than the other store's quickly packed too well.
"It sounds good, it's good, it's good, it's 100 meters, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good."
It's great. It's okay. I have to buy more.
Good speaker quality.
"If you're 15 years old, you'd better know the biggest play that's only three times bigger."
"The purchases aren't exactly like advertising, the speakers are small... but Tiki doesn't pay back, never order again in Tiki."
The product can't connect the phone.
"The metal handles are solid, heavier than the ones you've ever bought, the bag with which you've got it."
"Fast delivery, well packed, heavy, but not light."
"Sure, have a bag."
"Good price, package, quick delivery, unmoved delivery."
Good product.
"Sure, light, easy to use"
"It's a very good, neat product to carry with it."
Beautiful strong hard quality heavy Christmas presents mean
"The product looks like, sure."
There's got to be a hard bag. Okay.
"Thanks to the seller, so good for her."
It's nice.
"Sure, small"
Naipo
"The product works fine at a price range, but it's not as hard as it gets, and I try to put magnets where the magnets stick to the rack."
"It's light, it's neat, it's profitable."
"We're running out of batteries. Three hours is about the left battery. Even if it's on the machine, we're gonna have 50 percent left."
Why do left ear charge for about two hours without batteries?
"Batteries aren't so good, but sound quality's fine."
"The delivery on the right hand, holding the product to the root box, opened it up for a long time to connect both ears, very anxious to hear each side? The sound sounds solid, the bass sound is fine, because I'm picking up this earset because I saw PKCB's own brand, and the brand is very strange, so I'm buying my own weird ear from a silicon hearing ear?"
The delivery took too long to be heard in a bag.
"It's inappropriate to listen to calls, so it's good to listen to video music."
"You can't buy two, but you can't use it. You've been called by a tiki agent who's been calling you for so long, and you can't figure it out."
"Good sound quality, well-packed sipper delivery quick fun"
"You know, when you're done with your hand, your hand sounds pretty like a battery, which sounds pretty much like the sound part of you that's sound good in the air, opening up a big max, not too much on the quality of your own ear."
"It sounds good compared to the product at a price, it's great. It's good. It's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good."
"I've tried the product and I feel very, very, very, very, very, very fast delivery, very sensitive, very sensitive ears. The battery is going to last a long time at the average negative level. It's going to be okay."
I can only hear one ear.
"The first time I heard it so clearly that I thought I'd never turn my ear on and I was listening directly, but I'm sure the battery was going to last a long time."
I'm feeling pretty good at this price. It's okay. It's not bad.
"The headset comes in the whole box, and the sound is good because it's charged, the charge's hard, the charge's broken even if we can't get it out of the box, so we can't get the charge cable."
"Oke has spent over an hour on the 20-mile drive path. This is the problems of this product.1. The weak signal, as a child, has to change each other at times up to 2. The product doesn't hug its ears, it's easy to fall, it's not able to filter out, it's almost possible to listen to music in quiet places, it's sound to hear it all, it's very uncomfortable and it's very disturbing to hear music music music test 3."
"It sounds good, it's sensitive, it's been a long time since the average volume of sound. It's okay."
"An ear won't work, no sensors, no lights when you're charged."
"Took 228K for a headset to hear one side, which sucks."
I've got the goods. The store's too fast. The price is good. The product's good.
This is a terrible experience. <i>The ear hears about one side.</i> <i>We've been able to charge it overnight.</i> <i>The battery is very fast.</i> <i>I hope Tiki responds early on about the return policy.</i> <i>I'm sorry.</i> <i>I don't know.</i> <i>I don't know.</i> <i>I don't know.</i> <i>I don't know.</i> <i>I don't know.</i> <i>I don't know.</i> <i>I don't know.</i> <i>I don't know.</i>I don't know.</i> <i>I don't know.</i> <i>I don't know.</i> <i>I't know.</i>I't know.</i> <i> <i> <i>I't know.</i> <i> <i>I know.</i> <i> <i> <i>I know.</i>I know.</i> <i>I know.</i>I know.</i>I know.</i>I don't know.</i>I't know.</i> <i> <i>I know.</i> <i>I know.</i>I know.</i> <i> <i> <i>I know.</i> <i> <i>I know.</i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i>I know.</i> <i> <i>I know.</i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i>I know.</i>I know.</i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i>I know.</i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i>I
The earpieces are so good or the ears are always cool and there's these blabla-style sensors.
"It's like an hour out of batteries, dozens of klicks."
I've got a good headset with a good sound. It's so good. It's so good.
Give me beautiful product.
"Good product, fast delivery shop. I'll be back with you in a minute."
Next time you're gonna be able to buy some kind of shop support.
The store is also as prestigious as the sensitive model. Call the phone. It sounds like there's a light filter or something.
"So, what kind of connection is that without the name of Cisneros?"
Send missing accessories to exchange check-outs.
The first experience you've had is good. No problem. I hope you'll use it for a long-term hihi.
Too bad it's not even full in an hour.
Got it from the shop. It's pretty good.
I just got it and I'm getting ready to order more about it. It's better than I thought.
"It's nice, it's quick, it's loud, it's clear, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good."
"It's small, it's cute, it's not review yet."
Quick wave catch. The price has to be good. The price has to be used for a while before we know it.
"It's tiny, it's post-sensitivity, and the sound's fine at the price, so I don't ask for five more stars."
The product is good.
"It's a sensitive, convenient, easy-to-use product to carry anywhere, okay?"
"I've been listening all day. It's okay, it's okay. It's all right. It's all right. It's all right. It's all right."
"Okay, well, you know, every store that's got all the quality is off the table. It's off the 5-star store."
"Yeah, that's great. Yeah, that's great. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's great."
"Quick delivery, very soft ear."
The earpiece is fine compared to the price. The outside view is the same as the description. It's convenient to go out on the street and buy the product.
"You can't hear me, you can't charge 24 hours."
"All right, we're gonna have to get the headset out of the charge box, then we're gonna have to get the son of a bitch out of the box."
"The sound's good, the hearing's good, the china's so I don't know if it's sustainable."
One side can't connect.
"You're a cute, caring counselor. I've been thinking about it. I've decided to buy these headsets."
"His hearing sounds good, but his ear is kind of a pain in the ear, but it's okay, it's still good for the price, thanks to the shop."
"Wow, that's a nice headset. Finger sensors."
"It's a very nice product, sounds and sound quality are very good. I bought it on the right day, so it's a very, very cheap day. Good supply shop."
"It's shaped goods, loud sounds, good prices, good ears, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good to hear, it's good to hear, it's good to hear, it's good to hear, it's good to hear, it's good to hear, it's good to hear, it's good to hear."
Sounds good. It's a good negative. It doesn't hurt for a long time. It's okay.
"I'd love to. Thank you, thank you, shop. It's nice to have a product at work."
"The delivery doesn't look like the photo, and it's not connected right now."
"Just got the package, tried it out. Okay. Nice headset, little box. It's a little bit unsatisfy about the paper, blurtle, too small."
"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
Just got the sound line. It's good to see the music. It's good to see you. Thanks shop.
"The store is packed carefully, fully charged cable accessories. It takes a while to figure it out."
"I ordered tikinow so quickly, it sounds okay."
"It's been two weeks now, and all the laptops aren't able to track the device."
"Let's go, let's hear it, deliver the cave quickly, let's go!"
Why do you charge it with collusion? It's 70 percent back. I'm hearing half the battery is boring.
Great package. Make sure the whole set OK box is back up next time.
There's nothing left to judge... negatives are free.
"The product's good, but it's good. It's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good."
"I'm pleased with the package, but the rest of the stuff is packed carefully. With this price, it's very quality."
Great quality satle earpiece. Loud loud sounds connect goats easily. The company itself.
The earpiece is upside down. The left is right.
"The package is packed carefully, pick up the sound in and it's warm."
buy it for you so don't get any ideas
Triangulators. Large volume. P.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.E.
"The sound's fine. The signal's fine. Okay, fall's not gonna last."
"It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay."
I didn't think we could use it at first. It turned out to be the end of the battery.
"It's cheap, but it's real quality. I haven't been able to use any of the best, but this sounds good, so buy it."
"The good stuff, the sound's good at the price, the weak ear shouldn't open it, volum when you wear it."
"It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay."
"You know, you get lazy out here and you put your ears in there, and you're good for five."
"Easy-to-use connections, easily connected, very nice little style."
"Listen to me, I can hear you very well. There's a sonic microphone."
"Filling but currently 70 percent, the mic doesn't work:((((()))"
"I'll tell you what happened to Cai. Listen to me, I'll ask for your help."
It's okay.
The product's exactly the same.
"Big speaker product, warm bass, whatever it belongs to, it's a good dream."
"Good ear, beautiful, sure."
"It's very small, and it's one side, and it's one-on-one hearing."
It's nice to hear. It's good to hear. It's good to see you.
Quality is fine at the price range.
"The good delivery is not ready yet, so I don't know what it's like."
"We've lost one ear, we've only heard one side."
"That's good stuff. You should buy it, bro. Five stars."
Good headset. Good use.
Pleased Rat
Good price.
"Nice hearing, great sound, both ears."
"Welcome is Chinese. It's not you or Vietnam, so it's four stars."
It's been a long time since the Saigon battery. The delivery service isn't happy.
"Nice headset, sure, sounds good."
Nice headset. Good ear. Good ear.
"That's a phone call you're talking to. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no."
It's like advertising. It's great to hear.
I'll give you five stars if you have a good headset.
Okay.
"It's just one side, and the other ear has no signal."
"Too sensitive, always shut down."
"One ear picks up. One ear hears. No, the battery goes down too fast."
It's nice. I'll take a picture. I'll support the next one. I'm too lazy to take pictures of the sympathetic shop.
"Nice headset, easy to connect."
Pretty good at the price.
"I just got it, but there's only earpieces I can use."
"I can hear, I can't hear, I can't hear, I can't hear, I can't believe I'm wearing it."
Quality ok
"Sound quality, ears fit"
"Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait."
"Good sound, quick battery."
I'll come back for you.
It's a very quiet call.
"Get it for you, see it says ok"
Standard delivery based on description. fast delivery. sounds OK. will support
Okay.
Please.
It's too good for a price.
The charge box does not go to the light
Good product... quick delivery.
"It's too much. It's not possible to know what it is, but it turns out what it's like."
It's brilliant.
"Listen, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen."
Okay.
Quick transport.
headsets are good.
Good headset. Good bass.
bass sounds okay.
It's hard to believe. It's hard to believe.
Hurry up with the delivery.

"The buffalo battery, the red look on it, it's nice. There's a lot of apps, right for the price?"
"I'm pleased with MNNH Ruizu, so there's a Vietnamese manual, Chinese manual that doesn't work, and I have to find a way to use it myself, so I sell more electricity to the power drive when I charge it, without plugging it in the computer when I charge it."
"At this price, the machine is worth five stars, the aluminum body is steady, holding the armband, constantly playing at the restaurant for two days, buffalo batteries."
"It's kind of small. It looks like it's just connected to the microphone, not the phone."
"Sip super fast, get SP just two days after the office."
"The product's right for the description, very good quality."
"The quality of sound when you hear FLAC is not as good as what you think, whether you've used the Bluetooth Bose and Harman Kardon speaker, but it's also temporary for money. The screen resolution is poor. If you're connected to a Bluetooth speaker, you can't use any other machine's functions. Pin, the music box can play for nearly four hours without the battery going on."
"Dun g tot, wipe battery, am thank or General chat long Bluetooth tarm tam"
"I've bought a fully charged machine, I've spent the night running out of batteries, I've got four o'clock in the morning, I've lost my battery, I've copied high quality music, and it sounds like a bad noise, and it's very bad quality, although the machine's pretty sure."
"This one has many of the best features I've seen, only for a long time the source button will be lost, I've spent almost a year and I haven't been disappointed in it, it can wake up, record, read books, turn it off by the hour..."
"The quality of sound when you listen to Lossless music isn't very good, but it's not very good. The battery, many features, but the video feature is pretty useless when the screen resolution is 160x120 is too low."
"It's so disappointing for a product that the batteries don't go crazy, the whole evening charges are over, the next morning they're out, they're upset, they're listening for a little bit to stop the source."
"This machine is still playing through the machine's speakers, so it's not easy to wear earphones in public places where everyone can hear their music."
Like advertising.
"The machine buys a few meals, it's hot, and now the battery's broken, it's hot, it's open, it's 30 seconds off."
"It's a good product, but it's not sustainable, it's a few months, it's a battery, it's a display."
"The machine's box got a little bit of an opener, and it's already catatonic."
"My order reported delivery by 13 hours, and there's still no information at least 15 o'clock."
We'll take two now. He'll be fine. He'll be fine. He'll be fine.
I just sent it to the store. Why haven't I sent it to you yet?
"It's not a big deal, but I see the following points that need to be described to people: - Time to charge the batteries a little bit longer than midnight until 12: 00 p.m. the next day is full -- when you charge it with your iPhone, it's going to have an off-line between when you're back online and it's going to be charged. this might be normal, but it's also a remarkable phenomenon for people to pick up their products."
"If the battery doesn't come in, you're gonna have to call for backup, you're gonna have to keep the package in order to support it, you're gonna have to cut your face."
"Even if it doesn't fit, it'll change."

"Roger, loud, steady hand production in Indonesia, coming out of Europe."
"Try FM, you get a lot of channels. You see the red light, but sometimes you've heard a faint sound. AM can't get a channel. Maybe it'll take more time to evaluate it all."
"Nice looks, good quality, easy to track channels, clear sounds, and inner sounds."
It's good to have it on radio. It's good to have it on its own.
"It was light and loud, and I bought it for my grandfather, and he loved it."
It's okay. It's okay.
"Picking up FM radios and self-checking the good, much better than the Chinese radios in the market."

"- On the outside: + good complete product, personal code. + Instructive, warranty. - On the subject: + FM caught very few channels. + AM caught several channels in the country, abroad. + A lot of the shocks are very uncomfortable, especially when using 220V."
"I'm going to buy it for my mom, which is very low on the channel, which is kind of annoying, and I've called her to get the bill, so people should consider when they're going to buy it, especially if they're going to give it to her."
"The quality sounds good, the manipulation is simple, and the elderly who use this radio is reasonable, but the amount of waves caught seems a little low, about three or four channels."
"Design OK, slow-tracking transmissions are still a little hard, too noisy."
"The branding shop right here where the battery's tore, the battery's tore, and the stamp's not to be preserved."
You can't just buy it. You can't hear it.
Thank you.

"The Bluetooth connection took about five seconds, low quality like cheap speakers."
"There's no way to know if the battery's charged, if it's fully charged..."
The top part is rubed. and the volum is clear when ain't. little disposed.
"The goods are fine, but it's not acceptable to keep the stock out of store until it's delayed. I hope the shop and tiki fix it."
"Light speaker, medium negative, good Bluetooth connection, no more demand for this price."
I just bought it for four days. It just doesn't make sense. It just doesn't make sense.
The speaker sounds fine at the point of the price. The volume of hearing through the Bluetooth is quite small compared to hearing through memory cards.
The quality of sound at the bass price is not very good.

"The sound's small, the volume can't be adjusted."
The coral looks beautiful because of the grape britches through ambients.
"Good loudspeaker, good for the price."

"The typing keyboard failed, it's a waste of money on a useless product."
"I got the product set, but I got the rat broken, and I'm jumping around, and I don't see the warranty stamp on the mouse, so what happens now?"
"The keyboard is not sensitive, there are two new keys that you can use in less than a month because the day you go to work, the evening you use sometimes, but you've broken three non-verbal keys. It's quite disappointing."
"As quick as possible, using a few months as paralysis, a keyboard can easily break the source button"

"From a more personal point of view, it's a little bit thiner than the ones you used to buy, and you've got a little bit of a scratch on your face, and you've got a lot of pain on your back."
Quick delivery needs a better product.
"It's a pretty thread, approximately lots of pictures to pick, low price for Cons money: bad print, the color of the product isn't as bright as the ad, 35K delivery, and the delivery is too long?"
"It's generally quite fine, but it's a nice cx tip, and it's a speed mouse pad, and it's only about two millimeters thick, and it's not going to stretch, but I don't know if it's the fluid or why it's four days late."
"The package is only two months old with a very thin black plastic package, and when it opens it's empty, it's very broken."
"It's just been purchased, but it's been soiled, like an old product that's used to use a lot of stains."
It's got dirty pens. It's a lot darker than I expected.
What's the product okay?
"It's old and bad, but the quality is still a good pad."
"Look at the generals. They're good, but they're damaged."
"Pad just bought it, got a quick delivery, bought it the next day."
What kind of business is that?
"You know, if I didn't just put the mouse on it, I'd have paid off the two-star store because I'm confident I'd sell it."
"I've got silver, but I've got blue."
The product is smaller than the picture.
"The quality is fine compared to the price of money, but the print is distorted compared to the circle in the image and the color is not as good as the image!)"
It's beautiful. It's good.
"Pad smells of new plastic, it's a little uncomfortable at first, but the smell's gonna be all right after that."
Little bit.
Quick delivery.
"Fast delivery (very much). The product is quite dim compared to the image but mainly the underwear for the list, so it doesn't matter in general what the product is for the price."
Pretty much.
Okay.
"It's cheap, so the print's not clear. Other colors are a little disappointed."
"The product smells a bit, but it fits the price."
the shape is only an illustration.

Not as ostentatious as the image.
"It's a bit thin, but it doesn't have much to do with experience, it's worth it."
"The details, they're not as good as the pictures, but the materials in general are fine as the price of money."
The product doesn't match the image.
I'm really happy with this product.
That's what I'm talking about.

"The product's okay, but the delivery guy seems upset with the client, hoping he won't do it again next time."
The product's not doing very well.

"It's light, but it's hard, and it's solid!"
"It's very good, very good."
"The size's too small, so that thepad isn't good, we can just leave the phone."
It's normal. Nothing special.
The aluminum product is quite thick. The sense of stability is easy to use.

"It's worth it, less wrist pain, holding a mouse like nothing, each crime with no instructions on how to use Vietnamese."
"It won't take long, but it's consistent with anyone who uses it that moves at the right speed, and it's not appropriate to play video games."
"The quick delivery, moving back and forth between PCs is very smooth, light, soft, slightly small, compared to your hands, so it's a little uncomfortable, compared to the Master 3S, and the battery turns out to be using a urinary battery."
"The product's fine, it's a little strange at first."
"Real goods, fair prices, smooth move, no long use. 5 stars for Logotech."

Okay.

"It's pretty good for price, but it's not the best for ruizu, it's full of buttons, it's not the same as X52, it's the better for D10."
Menu code: 774 440257. Unable to connect to MPD Beats solo3. Requesting the vendor's press store.

"Only once you've unplayed it, you'll be white when you charge it again."
"Camera buys should be packed together, be sure, be careful, store delivers the right samples, raw seal, it's just that the Sxs have been keeping warrants for seven years but the shop doesn't mention the warranty mode or timeout, they don't see the warranty stamps."
"The product is carefully loaded, the package is intact when delivered, delivers at the right time, quality takes more time to evaluate, attaches and forgets to take a picture first."
"Main row, steady speed, good for cell cameras and phone memory cards."

"Quick delivery, exactly advertising, all right?"
Fast and friendly delivery man.

"I put my memory stick on a camera where the press camera hasn't received the card and there's a sound like an alarm, I put it right in the photo."
"The Shop is slow. In response to customers, it's hard to keep track of the customers who haven't used the product but certainly won't buy it next time. When you're done buying the store, you're going to have an error, and you're going to find another store."
U.S.V.V. 6gb. What's the U.S. store?
"Shop check your memory card, buy a 64GB card, install it with 1,8GB. It doesn't save anything."
"There's not enough capacity.64GB, where the cameras hold 120 hours."
"Buy it for the first time, bring another nameless product next time."
I just got the package. I don't know what it's like yet.
"The good product, at the expense of foreign purchases, is useful."
"The credit card's good. The price's good. You should buy it, everyone."
"The product's not working, the camera and the phone."
"Get the 64gb card back to see if it's 64 grams. If you put it on the test machine, there's 1,86 p.m."
Why can't I use it?
"The package is carefully packed, the package is exactly the same as the image."
It's all right. Put it in the camera. It's a little bit of a treble. It's the best in the price range.
"The package is well packed, the operation is normal, and the quality of the experience is new."
I don't know if it's sustainable.
Standby.
I can use it. I don't know what the quality is yet.
I'm disappointed.

"Even if you're sure to charge it quickly, you'll be happy at the shop."
Quick impact is good.
Okay.

"Good sound, no ear pain, fast delivery, full payment of tiki"

"The quality later doesn't know what it's like to be located right now, but it's about 10 meters off, but we need to turn off the LBS, so it's standard positioning, and it's pretty much a lot of good utility, and we're looking at what we need, but we should be able to figure out if we're going to buy another one."
"It's a good watch model. It's clear, it's standard, but it doesn't have video functions, but it's a good service shop after sales, it's a good guide, it's very trustworthy, it's not like many other stores are sold, it's sure to buy something that's going back to the shop."
"All right, I like the way the store calls the video, and I'm just setting up all the time, and I'm going to keep supporting the shop."
"Having bought a watch to locate it requires that you locate it correctly, which is good positioned, which is elegantly supported, even though you have a guide with it, you should ask the store when you first bought it."
The store delivered really quickly the other day has been booked. It's a wonderful product. I'm just not happy about the delivery guy who's so upset with the customer that I'm making up for the oke.
"The delivery store was fast, and I don't even know how to use the store to send the video that's about to expand the connection very happily."
"The position is very accurate, not the same as the previous purchase, okay, dot for the 5-star shop and the tiki super-fast delivery service, of people so don't wait for time, it's important that all the features like the store described are OK."
"The most sound and batteries are pretty strong, 9 points for quality, 10 points for how to take care of the store's clients."
"The mailmen didn't let the seal out, but they saw a good evaluation, and they were still paying off, and they thought they had to buy an Ibs, but the shop was just for re-adjusting, so the standard timing was, if you don't know all the features, ask the store, the guide shop, which is easy to understand, and the clock is very good, and I appreciate this product."
"It's a perfect line. It's a super-invigorating consulting shop. Quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick."
"Shop responds quickly, packs firmly, supplies are fine."
"The Load positioning's been a little too many times since update, but the plus point is the warm support shop after the store. Fast goods, packaged, easily installed, beautiful modeled, then known not as quality."
"I said the nice orange color, and I saw the shop with the lotus pink, so I wondered, the message to the shop is that it's a very nice orange color, and our baby likes it, and it's a long hope that it lasts."
SHOP is very enthusiastic and takes care of the customers very well.
The store delivers the right package model.
"Acceptable aesthetics, quality takes more time to locate OK, satisfied with post-sale services."

"Bh times 1, sim mobi usually doesn't get a signal."
"Ap does a lot of commercials, mics say anything, battery's running fast, asking for recheckers."
"The positioning feature is unstable, inaccurate. If you support it, the store won't admit failure function."
That's the end of the water.
The good product is easy to paste
It's as good as advertising.
It's a really nice company.
It's good. It's good. It's good.
"Used and satisfied, the wire seems solid."
"It's like advertising. Try to see it. Okay, good quality."
I've spent two months and I'm in trouble. I don't know if it's warranty.

"Sure, tough, rough"
"It's beautiful, it's barbarous, it's equal to 1-200K."
"Good stuff, just like him."
It's beautiful. It's the right product.

The company's main delivery's quick.
They're doing great.
"Okay, well, it's within range."
Good.
"I forgot to take a picture, but when I opened the box, I looked at the box that was pretty old, like I was selling my old stuff back, not my new box."
"It should take a while to deliver, but it's as beautiful as it looks."
Four cuts. Okay.
"Tiki's fast delivery service is very good! free delivery, but I don't know why you don't get the awards."
"Google has a very nice way of designing circles, and a very nice tip, and two batteries for remotes are also designed with very synchronizing colors. Remote has a lot of custom modes, which meets every need for connections, from the computer screen to the TV screen. The only difference is that YouTube on Chromecast is no longer free-ad, though not much."
"The goods are right, the delivery is fast, the outside of the box, even though it's labeled ""Admirable"" but the box is still broken, and unfortunately there's no problem inside, the product in the box is raw, put in a little bit of update waiting, and it's generally too happy between the waste money and the quality of the product."
"It's really cool, it's quick, it's smooth, it's very buyable, everybody who's a little bit old, buys this for use, saves a lot of money."
"The product is exactly what it looks like, the whole box. Starts a little while but the feedback and quality of the viewer, netflix is pretty good. You can install more apps, you can control and you can use it fully from the TV turned off, input to volum, so you don't have to use it to control TV."
"This is a fullbox, Google company, beautiful, small, nice-looking place. However, these five gigawatts are for the shop for selling the full box set. So that's OK. The price is normal (not the least but not as expensive as many other stores)."
"Fast delivery, packaged the entire set of boxes, extremely easy installation, simple use. There's also a remote set of television, now we've got a remote set of chromecasts."
"Wladek - Fast - Watch 4k movies that are super smooth and stable, but the memory is within 4.4Gb (Studently loaded with video and light video games for entertainment?)"
"The package is good, the box is not distorted, the experiment is smooth; there is a search for Vietnamese voice; the connection is simple, very neat and easy to see."
"Okay, good."
"There's no need to talk about it, and if you like it, you'll need a simple little remote to turn off the television, not two remotes like the other Boxes."
"The good stuff. Uses Google, so it's always up to date. Gets a pretty good voice. It's going to take a while, it's going to have to start up - Android's general disease."
"- Sets Tikinow on the day 1 :30 minutes later, I'm happy to use both chromecast 3, Google chromecast with Google TV and Mibox S4k combined the strengths of the following: - chromecast 3 carst video 224 from the phone to the VLC that's not down quality, and Google TV and Mibox 4K tells me that the remotes have to be fast and hot. - Google shows that 4k video from Fat32 will be turned off by 4MMMMDMDX (4K) and then can be turned off using only 2DDDDDDDDDDDVDVPVPVX, but can be turned off by 4MDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDVDVDVDVD"
"Use your home well, full CSV, netflix, no other apps. Use LG's corn app instead. There's a remote that can use to turn off the television. The connection is a little complicated."
"The whole box is loaded, and when you install it a little while, because you have to update the software. After you're finished, it's very smooth."
"Ship bought the second one, and he likes Google smarts, and he wants to make Tiki's prices as much as any other app."
"The good product, it's just a little bit of time to install it, but the next time we use it very smoothly, my parents can use it."
"The whole package, apps running like phones, mostly buying them for TV apps, so it's nice to dig."
"It's a cute little product, it's a smooth work, it's like Google, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice."
The product with Taki Now support should deliver super fast 2 hours to the bed.
"Quick delivery, Made in Thailand."
"The package is integrating. Few buttons should be quite easy to use, however, unless there is no audio output, so if you're buying it for music, you should consider it again."
"The main goods, fast delivery. The connection and operations are stable. The app only works best. The browser on Chrome Cast is not appropriate for viewing movies. Use kdmPlot is very convenient."
"It's Google's top, it's still more than a month's worth, it's more than a couple of other firms, it's smooth, it's very fast, it's less jumpy, it's just the WiFi net is not standing."
"Small, nice, easy-to use devices the first time they're used, with little support from the Androids. MyTV needs to be installed through downloader. The remotes will sometimes lose connection, unmounted batteries."
"Packing and shipping OK, connecting with monitor OK, the old blue doesn't look as good as white, 807K is cheap, the SN code on another machine. A D/E character versus outside the box!"
"The device is well used. Updated to Android TV, the latest 12 copies. The initial settings are a little bit difficult for someone who doesn't know the technology. When installed, it's easy to use, smooth operation, quick feedback, very stable use."
"I don't have 4k but I've got dolby's backup speaker atmos, so watch the standard dolby movie."
"Super fast delivery during the season, packaged goods are carefully packed, the whole set of boxes, the easy ones, use a lot of apps, the smooth ones in the UI. 10 points!"
The good stuff's Googled. It's O.K.E.O.
"seal raw, small design chromecast, fine quality, smooth-use interfaces more than other American box, fast delivery tiki"
"The whole set has spent a few days, the prestigious shop, sharing with all of you the same experience and support the shop."
"But the service is a little limited to the need (for example). Try cast screen screen from chrome on mac, but the delay is relatively low, sharp even through progeria."
"The product is exactly the way it is described, the beautiful pattern, the remote is easy to use. The program can run quite smoothly. It can install additional entertainment viewing applications."
"It's a real fullbox, quick delivery, good price."
"Sile hunting gets a good price, tiki nowships fast for an hour, very pleased, raw product seal used well"
"Main goods, good prices, full support."
"tiki delivered quickly, packed carefully, product ran fast and smooth, meeting his needs well"
"It's so smooth, it's worth a lot of money."
"It's a beautiful blue, it's easy, it's smoother than a xyomi, though it's much smaller."
Very good.

"It's nice, it's nice, it's really nice."
Which money is worth more than a month of double-clicking.
It's too bad... it's a waste of money to read before you buy the yeast.
"The product I realized was broken, it couldn't be used."
"The first feeling is a good particle accelerator, which fits the price of money."
"Packed well, whole set, fixed machine, appropriate price, sound quality fine, generally, if you want to buy it, you should buy it."
"Same as always, packed carefully, right description, this price is fine, it's experiencing more."
"I bought the product two days ago, I got into a sink, and I didn't notice, but even though 99 percent of my stomach was broken and I couldn't fix it, and I sent it to you because it's my fault, it's my fault, it's my fault, it's my fault, it's my fault, it's not my fault, it's my fault, it's my fault, it's my fault, it's my fault, it's my fault."

"Steady machines, long-term batteries, steady use."
The buffalo batteries don't last forever.
Shipper delivers as quickly as possible. The product is packed very carefully.
It's very satisfying. It's a very good product.
Let me ask you what's wrong with increasing the volume of the machine.
"Use good music, the product's fine, it's all right."
"When you open the box, there's an unsmelling industrial plastic smell."
"The machine basically responds to its needs, and the only exception is that the seller announces that there is no DM Recording function, while the machine is able to do it, if you know you've already bought four instead of just one."
"Buying it for me, made out of plastic, doesn't have a high level feeling; it doesn't sound very good to hear from iphone 5s; it doesn't feel good with MiA1 mobile phones."
"The sound of the machine is quite good, the bass strip is obviously not like the cheap machine, but the earphone comes with only fireproof quality, so with its own headset, it's okay."
"We've just received the package, and we've got the light machine, and we've got the earpiece, and we don't know how long it's gonna take, but there's no speaker on it, Renard."
"You know, before you buy, you also read all sorts of stuff, you decide to buy it, okay, you can use it for three months, you can turn it on, you can turn it on, you can turn it off, you can't turn it off, you don't know what to do with it, you don't know what to do with it."
"It suits the price, the curtain's a bit light, but it doesn't matter."
Why does the charge product not have to use the power directly?
"Everything's okay, but my colored plug is cracked, and I'm lucky to use a lot of it, and a nx flaw isn't loaded."
"Quality goods, easy to use, quite a buffalo battery."
"The headset, the player, and the charge cable are good, but the memory card is missing, which is in the accompanying information."
good product
"The delivery is one hour behind, and the product is very carefully packed, and it hears the Escondidos, the radio, which can't be reached at any price."
"The clown product is the same as what advertised, disappointed"
"All right, the kid listens to music without being addicted to drugs."
"The price is reasonable, the quality of the machine, the beautiful model of code."
"Feels very good at first, delivers at exactly the right time, machines are fine, running all falc, we don't know how we'll use them."
How come there's no Vietnamese? I don't understand it.
"Tiki hasn't delivered yet, it's a day late. We're in a hurry."
"Put the music back on and listen to it again and then you turn it on, and the logo stays still, and you don't buy it."
I can't use the headset.
Can you show me how to download music?
"Let me ask you what a 64G memory card is, I got the phone without a memory card attached."
"Check the code, it turns out it's some kind of ruizu player."
"Good products, easy to use, sounds match value"
"The sales season should take a long time... but the store is very thoughtful, the package is solid, the package is, like, quality should be bought."
"Thanks to the shop, we'll be back in support!"
"Fast delivery, beautiful machines, sensitive sensors, and it's important to hear FLAC music."
machine good
"The new one, I kind of like this one that D25 buys this one, but I've judged the gate that's loose, I've got to play it for a while, it's normal, it's uncomfortable to move it or put it in my pocket, it's almost every time I listen to music, it's about whether or not it's going to fall out, it's pretty disappointing to me, I've been able to buy a machine for a week, I don't know how long it's going to be able to use it, but it's kind of awkward, and I don't want to do it, and I don't want to do it with a lot of other things."

"It's a little small, and it's 50 percent loud with normal ears, and it's still 70 percent small."

"The first step is this: Use oke. Use oke well, write well. Pack carefully. Clothed. It looks new. Full instructions are available. The price is perceptual or cheap. The output of China is almost the length of a 15 - 6 inch laptop (3 cm) screen; the width is equal."

The machine's on the phone. It's good. It's good.
Be careful with the package. I've been working on it for a while. It's okay to use it for a while.

"The goods are available, however the brands are reevaluated because they're not exactly the same video described (see logo prolink), don't be packed by tiki."
"If you can use it for a few days, you can't control the mouse."
The real mouse works finely. The box's exactly the same. Each one's a little too big. It's a little tight on the machine.
"Unable to use the mouse, forbids it to run, the shop helps itself with this problem"
"It's okay, it's not very smooth, maybe it's because there's no underwear."
"The batteries cost three weeks, and the extra batteries only one to two weeks."
"The product reaches demand compared to the price, but the delivery time is long."
"Rats don't work very well. Two weeks without batteries to play games, it's too bad."
It's only been a week. It's been a week.
"It's okay. It's a little hard, it's a good hand."
"Hey, otee."
"The red LED is the old technology, the battery cost."
I don't know what kind of computer this mouse is.

Nice mouse but happy press
"No web receiver, can not use it"
"The store is packed, the delivery is fast, the product is described, the quality is good, the color is good."
"Okay, first of all, it's a little heavy, after a while it's gonna take off the shell."
"Good skin, super fast delivery."
"Fast delivery, excellent quality."
It's very nice to use the shop.
Good.
Good quality in terms of money.
"Looks like good product quality, fair price, worth buying."
"The skin skin fits with the iPad Air, enjoying this product very much."
"It's a beautiful product, thank you."
Why isn't it the size of buying an Ipad Air?
There's no place for leather to be the point for thepad to stand.
It's nice. The store gave me a backpiece that looks like a good show.
"It's leather. OK, it fits the price."
Appropriate within price range
"You need to take a picture,hr. Real good."
"The colors are elegant, the product is huggable, it's easy to open, the delivery's early, it's good to protect."
Okay.
"Set black intersection blues, cheaper black than 8,000 GHz"
"If you put it in black, it's too tough for Lam. You shouldn't buy a single not up to 82k, but the 83k Post says it's gonna be for a few thousand dollars and you don't like it."
It's a little slippery. It's all good.
"Pleased, got the product fit"
I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.
"It's light on the back, but it's very sure."
Okay.
Very pleased.
Satisfaction
"Thank you, Tiki."
"Nice leather, nice cloth, tight, nice good stuff to buy, reasonable price."
"The thick skin, for sure, I bought the gray one that looked pretty good, and the price was 190K, and it was just a little unsatisfying that the inside of it had the edge to hold on to the machine."
"It's hard, the one you've been using all year is new because you've been using it for a long time, you don't tear it, it's a good price."
"Beautiful, five-star quality."
"Beautiful skins, hang-ins, raw seals, can stand up machine to use"
"Very pleased, beautiful product."
"It's a really cool package, the quality of the skin bag is as good as the description of the shop."
It's pretty good.
"Quick delivery, nice product, fit the iPad 7 10.2'."
I don't know if it's a good thing to give you five stars and you don't know if it's worth more.
It's okay.

"Good luck, sure, if there's a button to put both sides on it, well, that's good, but it's okay with the price."
"Sets the price of 195k with an internal application given an extra millimeter iphones X, but when you get the product, you don't get the iPhone X. Then the Sip 56k total of 251k and no gifts that feel like you're being rejected."
"Fast delivery, quality OK as Tiki's newscast"
"Okay, sure."
It's not very tight. It's a nice color.

"- It's not ""nillkin"". It's a terrible quality of energy. It's a lot like those two-and-a-half night markets that sell 200k, boul."
"It's been a long time, and it's got a lot of dust on it, so it's taken care of pretty good."

"Okay shop, very nice and fashionable"
Good product.
"The company's main product, quality noise resistance, I bought and listened to music, and I worked very well, and I bought 1111 for a discount, and I got 5th grade four, so I got it, and I got it, and I got it, and I got it, and I got it, and I got it, and I got it, and I got it, and I got it, and I got it, and I got it, and I got it, I got it."
"I've been around a couple of times, I've been down 5/790k, I've got moca 300k, I've got 5/5, I've had a nice little bit of blood flow, I've got a headache because I'm not used to it."
"The outside earpiece is beautiful, the leather is good, it's smooth. It reduces the noise very well, it doesn't listen to the sound outside. The pop button is easy to use. It stops the music when it opens its ear, hits one side of the ear to hear sound outside, or lowers the sound with very convenient sensors."
"The firm's main, raw, reliable, fast delivery tiki in an hour has been received, the sound is tough, the sound is pretty good, the voice is good, the voice is high and it's still soundy, it's comfortable, it's funny, it's sweaty, it's cool, it's okay, it's okay, it's able to adjust itself, it's also loud noise-proofed, it's like the world around you and it's cool, it's cool."
"It's super loud, it's long, it's not hot, it's ear pain, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's play, pause, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good."
"The package has to have a code to get it, it's safe to buy a high price at tiki to say it's safe and secure."
"The brand-new box, which looks very fancy, I hear that the sound quality is good, and the cubbox resistance is about 70 percent, generally okay, plus other functions in the apps for customization."
"The earpiece has a great quality of sound, no qualms, enough bass, smart equipment that sets up sound abilities, depending on the user. Your favorite feature is probably to reach the ear when you want to talk to other people, and continue listening to music at the end of the conversation."
"The whole set, the delivery's fast. The quality of the earpiece is not a table."
"The company's main product, anti-scramble quality and sound equivalent to XM3. The feeling is less than XM3, the headband isn't as smooth as the old one."
It's not until 8:00 a.m. the next morning that TIKI called the agency to pick up the 2nd row.
"Advantage: The sound is fine, the sound is fine (about 70-80 percent of the external phone), which is appropriate for you to focus on or read. This is used at once, and the sound is pretty smart, but it doesn't have to be broken, so it's pretty much like this place (XM3). The point is: Put a bit of pain in your ear, so if you want to buy it for a long time, you should think about (the person who wears about one hour to feel bad and pretty bad). Besides, if you don't have a cold or secret, your ears are a little hot."
It's perfect.
"The delivery is two days behind schedule, but it's the disease that should be sympathetic to TIVA, the main product, the great noise resistance."
"It's good music, it's good sound, it doesn't have ear pain, it sounds a little hot, it's okay, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good."
"The whole sequence, the intact box, and the tikinow delivered it very quickly, less than nine hours before it was received."
"The delivery is faster than I thought, the product is original, the firm itself, the negatives are off the table, the auto-connection is great, the ambients are great."
"It's not as if there's a total silence, there's still a little noise going on, maybe it's because I'm wearing a mirror. Okay?"
"It's a good ear, good noise, nice package, fast delivery Tiki."
"That's a quick delivery, booked on the 10th and 12th and 10th at noon, and the price of ale 5590k is too cheap for quality, the ear is so smooth, it's not so painful, it's hard to hear, the music of Sony is well-known, thanks to Tiki Trading for bringing the super quality stuff."
"Main row, raw seal, fast delivery tiki. good sound hearing ears, clean wear, steady apps."
"The ability to connect two convenient devices, however not smooth is yet. Auto-remissioning music when you leave your headphones and fire automatically when you put them back on OK."
"Nice earpiece, quality, five star tiki. Very pleased about the package and delivery of the product."
"I didn't like earpieces like this before, but when I was wearing these, I was kind of fascinated by my earburst, and I didn't hear loud noises."
"Tiki delivers super fast, packaged with careful shock resistance, and Seal alone, with Sony warranty (I hope not to be used). The ear is too loud, the sound is pretty good for me, easy to transport, the low price."
"TikiNow delivered super fast, the payment failed, but called up the core with intense support, and the ear is off, which is relatively fine, V-shaped, highly loud noise-proofed, packed bags to carry."
"The fullbox, the firm itself, full of stamps, the fast delivery of Tiki, the sound of the ear, has great features, and it's best to wear them and shoot them in one ear so you can hear them and talk."
"Got it from the November Black friday, which was super expensive, which was delivered a little bit faster than two hours ago -- sound quality and build."
"It's beautiful, it's nice, it's light, it's good sound quality, it's good noise, it's good noise, it's good noise, it's good noise, it's good noise, it's good noise, it's good noise, it's good delivery."
"It's quick delivery, yin doesn't have to talk about it."
100% genuine. Love the sound and funtions.
"I bought it on Sunday, I got it on Monday, I bought it at six and a half million, so it was fun."
"Quick delivery, good product, worth money. deserve to be the Fagship of sony in the ear line"
"Detonating noise. Listen to great music. However, the s witch feature between the two devices is not as convenient as on airpods. You have to stop/off the audio app on the device, and then you can listen to music on the device 2. Still give five stars because of the noise quality and sound quality"
"The sound is okay, it doesn't matter, it doesn't matter, it doesn't work, it doesn't make sense, it doesn't make sense, it doesn't make sense."
"It's okay not to wear negative noise, it doesn't sound like review on the Internet. It doesn't sound good, the default sounds good, so that eq is exided, the bass is a little too much, it feels like a whole other strip. (compared with wf-500) Okay, the bamboo doesn't sound good, but the bass mid is okay."
"The earpiece is brilliant, it's no big deal, it's no big deal, it's no big deal, it's no big deal, it's no big deal, it's no big deal, it's no big deal, it's no big deal, it's no big deal, it's no big deal."
"The plus for Tiki Now, high-speed delivery of Sony raw product, looks good, sounds good."
"I don't like it when I put on my headsets and my earphones, and I don't turn on my music, and I still hear talking, and I'm just hoping from somewhere else, and the amount of batteries I had wasn't used to being used to being a little bit of ear pain, but then I was wearing them all day long."
"Opens the sound quality, listens to the water flow from ear to ear, the bolero music hears every few clicks."
"It's good hearing, it's good sound, it's bad noise, but the battery's like an introduction."
"I'm not very good at listening to music, but it's great to stop the noise, and now I can read books freely in public, and I can't even play music, but I can still focus against noise."
"It's great, it's great, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good."
"Advantage: good products, nice blues, first wear a little earache, but intense, good sound, sound, earshot, hearing very loud, and the heavy rain at about 50-60 still doesn't sound loud. The motion sensor works. Distinguished: for a long time it sweats out because it's so tight, it doesn't listen to your voice that it's so clear that sometimes it's more common to say than normal."
"We just got the product, so we got longer than we expected, full of stamps, warranty, accessories."
"It's a great product, there's no point at 10/10, it's very light, it's almost completely sound, it's beautiful, it's advanced, it's very fast."
"- Tiki delivers a great 2-hour supply - proseal product, it's the same company, it's the steady, it's the sound, it's good, it's the loud noise, it's the quiet, it's the noisy environment, it's the car, it's the plane, it's the baby... - It's a lot of cool feature, it's a soft noise, it's a lot of the time, but it's going to get used to it."
"Conveniently, sitting out on the street at peak hours that are quiet suddenly. sound in and out of detail than xm3. Best ear!"
"I can't hear you on the right, I've been changed by Tiki, it sounds good."
Sony's most high-end hearing ear doesn't have to talk about quality.
Tiki's policy and answers were good and very quick.
"The hearing earship is fast and carefully packed. the throbbing part of the head when it feels like it's hitting the top of the head a little bit uncomfortable, and this is the main weakness that hasn't improved at the xm4. The rest of the noise and noise level 8/10."
"The product still smells of new plastic, some people will be upset with it, but for an electronic addict like themselves, it's pretty high, it's pretty high."
"During the trade season, which is super fast, there's the whole set, ear pressure, noise resistance."
"The delivery is more than expected. All right, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go!"
It's too good for a love affair. 11/10 sound quality.
"The initial quality of sound is okay. If you want to hear it, you need to hear more time."
"The package is too fast, it's been reported for an hour and it's been delivered to the door, the real product, the whole set of ants, the blue is slightly darker than the image, but it's still beautiful."
Everything's okay except for the short charge cable.
"Now, it's all about bass, so it sounds more like bass, and it's more like a manual mode in V-sharp, which is really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, I don't get a point from my point of view, is that when I sneeze or something, you know, I'm telling people to get disable right now:"
"The earpiece is very uncomfortable, sometimes forgetting to wear it. The app has many options, and when it comes to hearing it, it doesn't sound as good as the sony inear, but after the EQ, it's extremely timed: D and especially not a lot of ear pain (except of the MDR-X55AP). The point may not be as good as the bass that might be due to the way the individual feels."
"I've bought it from social extensions so far, I don't know how many times I've been away from society."
"There's nothing to complain about. Meet your needs properly. ambient sound is great, generally satisfied with sp quality and the service of TIVA season. 10 stars also."
"It's all right for those who love the bass-based sound matter, the design for the head-to-head, the earpiece is pretty secret, so they're going to have to take it off for an hour, and they're going to have to take it off, and it's just a little bit of trouble with the ear charge, and it's going to be super short, 10 centimeters, and it's going to be complicated every time."
"The delivery wasn't so fast, it took three or four days to get it, packaged, careful, cover for the collision, good product, quality, full warranty."
"The brand new set, the accessories, the warranty, the quality. No noise resistance is table. m glasses should be a little uncomfortable wearing them for too long, but this is the softest pad of the sample, which is good for five."
"Standard delivery, HCM - A day's delivery is good. Every crime doesn't have any instructions in English. It's good to have apps in Vietnam."
How come I don't see a gift?
"Sp sounds great, smooth ears, good noise resistance."
"It smells good when you open the box, but it feels good."
It's nice. It's a box. Use it now. Good quality.

Tiki knew how to paste broken product stamps and put in a sticky sheet of paper to stop the shock? Poor enough to wrap the customer with a couple of shock-proof nilongs?
Blue doesn't look like a sp image.
"Real Review: Real Review: Realest sound: Real music is only good, but it's fitting for multi-party hearing; I hear from EDS, Pop/ Bad/ Ballal, classical media, music, and so on -- well, it's a good answer, but also an EQ in app to reduce bass, but yet at some high levels of piano communication, there's a light answer, there's no way to be able to produce the EQ in yourself, but there's a pretty good deal with the C."
"Quick, beautiful delivery, raw seal, each with a scratch on the headband:) lama Tiki? am I?"
"There's no problem with the product, but Tiki's package and delivery is too bad."
"And I ordered it before the city of Jeckdown, and I ordered it 10 days ago, but my friend got it 10 days later, and then I got it 17.8, and I didn't get it until today."
"Tiki works without any responsibility, and when the customer's orders are returned in three days, then processing the information in three, four days, then theship for the customer is more than a week away, while the customer is on TIT now, when the customer's customer fails to get it back, then using the slowest service to get it back."
"It's okay, 70 percent loud, medium bass, no long ear pain, because your ears are full of hearing, your sound quality is probably the same as 500K hearing ears. It's not the same as how long you're going to know how long you're going to last."
"The quality of sound, the convenience of not discussing it, the quality of the battery, but the quality of the sound is going to make you hard, and I've heard loud noises for a few hours, but after I use sp, every time I hear loud noises, I get dizzy, I've got to lie down, I've got to lie down, I've got to lie down, I've got a better ear attack, I've got to think about it."
"The company itself, the whole belt, the whole package, the company's security card, the fact that tiki's delivery took too long, and the phone went on several times."
I'm moving from Airpod 1 to Sony WH-XM4 because I'm pretty much in need of audio-canceping. Airpod Pro is the price. Airpods don't really like it very much.
"The experience was pretty good, but it didn't sound as good as it would have been. A few little noises could still be heard: for example, the little whistle, the snap of the hand, even if I tried to tap lightly on the surface of the object, it still sounds good."
"Long-term battery earphones, stable connections, sound-playing modes that are convenient for anyone who's not used to wearing sound-proofs, caressing, caressing the volume, caressing the left, turning the cards."
But some features I don't like about this one.
"Tiki, new order, super fast delivery, pick up the goods and check out the introduction to the new price of 500K?"
It's too small. It's too loud. It can't get rid of it. It's still listening.
"After a month of ordering, you'll finally get the product, and you'll have to say that the negative and the negative is not going to make any sense."
"The hearing ear is listening for a while, and suddenly it's silent. We have to turn it off and turn it back on. It's a constant situation. It's very uncomfortable."
"Not like the ad, bought it for use, but the quality is not equal to MF33, which, using it, hears every voice around it, whether it's using deaf mode, whether it's because it's because it's that or it's wrong."
"Sound resistance quality is good, but sound quality sounds normal, little bass."
"Well, the technologies that come with it are good, the sounds are bt, are not different, even try the loudssless feel but are not as good as the skullczy 320k ear that we buy,"
"The ears are light, the ears are good, the music is good, but there's a loud noise in the Noise Cancelle system that sounds very uncomfortable."
"The ear's fine, but the package's too tight, moving from south to north without a pad."
"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no., no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no"
"That's a great product. The delivery guy fell on the ground like a flag. It's a dead end, and who's in charge. Twozzzz."
"Sony's hearing quality is so great, there's nothing to argue about negative matter and noise resistance."
"I don't know what's wrong with my headset, but I can't get my headset up."
Uses a period of feature power function off when no use is active.
"You can't hug him too closely, you can just wear a cup of coffee or inside."
"The good product, tiki delivers fast, but if you think tiki should just put a Styrofoam around the crate to limit the impact, you'll rate five."
"The headset battery only uses 20 hours, not 30 hours, as recommended."
"The earpiece's fine, but sometimes it's in the right ear, but it's not clear, it's got to be in Sony's maintenance center."
"Listen to music okay, stop noise okay, take out sounds like cars run, engine good, still listen but small, Tiki delivers fast"
"Bad hearing, bad quality of Bluetooth connection or trouble."
"Good earsets, good noise resistance. minus: quick hearing, long-term wear will be uncomfortable."
"You know, it's pretty mysterious, and it's easy to sweat."
"The package's too slow, five days later than it was supposed to be."
"Sounds good, good material."
The ear is hot and heavy.
"It's a good product, but it's a four-star drop for making it two-and-a-half hours late for delivery."
The delivery is four days slower than expected.
The experience sounds like shit.
The delivery's a week late.
The ear is too good.
Batteries are weak.
I'm fine.
I can still hear the tv.
Fine.
"The main charge, the main charge, the whole set, high-speed charge of QC, which is PowerPoint, which is OK, which is quick to charge both iphone and angiulo, which is much better than the company with the machine, tells you to buy, I buy 225, I get 5k and 220, theship tikinow delivers 2 hours and 25K, half as a total of 245K."
"It's charged with electricity, nice form, low price, sustainable hope."
Hangf did a better job.
Satisfaction
"It's fine, it's not hot, it's charged at the same time as an iphone and a ioslave watch!"
"It's too good to use, it's well packed, it's much better for the shop."
"It's called super fast, close-up."
fine quality good style
That's fine.
"Okay, quick charge, no heat."
Good.
Hurry up with the delivery.
It's going too fast. Okay.
"Good hit, quick delivery..."
"Sf used well, fast delivery, very pleased."

"Slow delivery, phone calls for delivery personnel, off the line."
Gjjjjkbn
It's okay. It's good.
That's a quick hit.
Fine.
Okay.
"The three-headed, convenient charges, charging the phone lines, even if it looks like it's going to work."
"But the iphone head is just one side into the electricity, so it's got to be on the right side of the charge."
"SP piled up, sure end, there were three different kinds of plugs, which were very convenient."
"Use very fancy, quick charge, daily spears, should buy"
"Quick delivery, right product."
"It's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good."
"The good product, the quality, the right price."
Thank you.
Okay.
"Low quality wire, lower-head wire, less than normal, hard to identify when it's used."
The charge is solid. It charges multiple phones at the same time.
"There's a phone book that doesn't keep track of the number. The shop. If there's no solid install, then how can you install solid on dither mode?"
"Fast delivery, on schedule, good product, easy to use, however, is always an advertising viewer when it opens with a subtraction point."
"The material's good, the style's good, the battery's fast."
The product is exactly the introduction.
"You can't use sim mobi, sim vina."
"She's not feeling very well, so she can't get a call."
"On time. Good call quality, bad position."
"No, it's not okay. The battery's gone fast."
It's pretty easy to scratch.
Good.
Good.
That sounds a little complicated.
Okay.
"It's the same line with fake brands, but we don't know yet, the next time we're going."
"Advantage: There are apps, localizations, good prices, setport oki, loss of a message to ask for support. If there is an external shell, there should be no WM or when the installation is 3G, the cost of the clock."
"The watch is pretty, the color is really nice, it's easy to install a watch with sim on it, it's easy to buy Y85 yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy"
"Nice watch, she likes it a little bit, but it's still within the range, and it's worth it."
"Advertising is good, buying is bad, the battery doesn't last more than a day, while you're buying something cheaper than a battery that's been in less than a week."
"Yes, it's a description. It's a function, it's a function, it's a function, it's a function, it's a function, it's a function, it's a function, it's a function, it's a function, it's a function, it's a function."
"I just don't want to apologize, but this is the product, so you should read it carefully before you buy it, don't be like me."
"The package's sealed, the mailman's not gonna let us seal it, but he's got a good judgment, so he's still paying for it for a couple of days to evaluate the battery for two days, and he's hearing it very well, not as timid as he used to be."
"The battery goes down very fast, usually down and has to restart, which is best not to buy, and I'm contacting it to re-check it."
It's as wonderful as it looks!
It's a beautiful watch that's so rich that it's a size-one match for extra money that's out of sight.
"So any of you want to buy more thanta, this isn't a compatible product."
"Fast delivery, carefully packed, easily installed, beautiful pattern"
"Nice watch, smooth touch, clear call."
"The delivery is fast. The blue one's pretty. The bell is pretty loud, if the highest level can sound like a speaker, hopefully it'll last a lot longer."
"I bought 19/3, he loved it and used it very carefully, but today it's not even been two months."
"Nice watch, as you can see, has the ability to send a voice message, take a photo, quality ok, a fine guide shop"
"He's not like the picture on the picture, he's practically worthless."
A hundred grand machine meets the right store.
Nice watch. Celebrity store.
The new product is rubber quality.
Okay.
"Close your bags carefully, with fake stamps, pretty watch, yet sd up without the battery dk"
But... it's actually not much better if I don't buy the next one than the test one.
"The watch was beautiful, the baby was light, and since the baby had five, he gave her the instructions to call himself, so she's easy to use, and it's all managed by apps."
Feels good.
"It's a great product, it's called, but I don't know where else to put it, doing more research."
"Fast transport, dedicated shop, good ads, fake stamps, but not up, probably from huge amounts."
"Put the same SlM into two devices to compare it, and this makes it weaker than the phone, sometimes in some places where there's no signal."
"Two months later, the speaker broke, sent it to the maintenance store, and the store said it wasn't ready, so I got rid of the machine."
"Nice watch, quality, with sim on it. It's okay, it's okay."
"The caller's good, but it's not located because it's not connected."
It's no good. It's no good.
"I bought it, and I got it, and I got it, and I put it on my neighbor's back, so I bought it for him."
"Quick delivery The clock is correct the first quality is okay, then it's not clear."
"The delivery is fast, compared to the price it costs. It's pretty good to buy one like this. Okay, I'm good to go."
"Very, very pleased with the clock, very loud sound speaker, no squeamish at all, not as rough as the last time you bought, worth the money."
"Nice delivery clocks, quite smooth, easy to use,"
"The software watch is easy to use, text the store to respond with enthusiasm."
"The software watch is easy to use, text the store to respond with enthusiasm."
"KO charge cable, but it's okay."
"Use the 4-g sim you can use, manage with your parents' phones."
"The clock is so beautiful, so instructions aren't hard to install."
It's very good. It's OK.
Been buying tendons for a year.
It's okay. It's easy to use.
Thanks to the shop.
That's what you're asking for when you're buying.
"I bought it for sim but I didn't get it. If you could show me how to do it, can you teach me how to do it?"
"She's wearing nice, she hears good, she hears good, she hears good things, she hears good things, she hears good things, she hears good things, she hears good things, she hears good things."
The camera's constantly reflecting. Not yet.
A three-day high-performing self-sustainer shop that uses multi-tasking machines.
"The machine's good, but I'm sorry to hear that the teacher didn't put it on hic class..."
"The product's ok as advertised, I'm very pleased with the product!!"
"Second buy, very good product, very good work."
"pretty-looking, easy-to-use screen"
"Two months of screen striping, three-and-a-half days of battery power."
We can't catch Wi-Fi for the device. Too few features compared to the amount it's spent.

"Nice used to see the quality, so buy it."

"But Tiki's delivery is too bad, it's never called a delivery call, but it's still up on the app."
"Handing over the right product. I didn't know to start texting, so I was a little nervous."
"Sim sent back unactivated, called the operator for 1 year of use - fast, on time - the Vina wave where they're relatively stable should be well used unfortunately with freeship code not used:"
"I'm sorry, sp for a year of skin use and I'm getting a free Internet call for 200 minutes."
"Sim has already activated it. It's already used. It's about 10 days, but it doesn't. At HCM the wave is very stable, uploads from 225mbs, sometimes up to 40 mbs. On app vinaphone sees more time than 2022, spending more than a month on self-resolved months."
Good.
The store is too prestigious to deliver on time. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much.
"How are you guys doing? It's a fast network speed. That's the number up there that's gonna activate, and you'll notice that you pick the nice number for, like, 12 months."
"The Shop and the tikis are so fast, they'll be booked by noon tomorrow."
"Supporting quick triggers, enough data and date effect such as buying 13/03/21 Day trigger 16/03,2021 The date expires 11/03,2022 = enough 360 days"
"I've got a lot of money. I've got a lot of money. I've got a lot of money, I've got a lot of money, I've been thinking about buying two sims for a while, but I've been thinking about it, and now I'm happy to buy a shop for the sims tomorrow."
"Ship came in pretty quickly, ordered at noon, seven o'clock at night."
"I used the second day, the network was good, the sim activated 26 days ago, the shop paid 11 days, next time it'll back us up."
"It's a year's worth of days, it's not activated, it's a month's wait, it's all right."
"Okay, quick delivery, good luck with the store."
Got a good delivery store.
It's a quick delivery. It's a good network.
"Sim hasn't activated the package, sent in by itself and got enough of the 12 months of free 4G a day"
The fast delivery was ordered yesterday. There's no shortage of unactivated sims. It's just not very good here. It's not very good.
Sim 4g run fine.

"I've been living here for four hours, and my life is as slow as a bull turtle, and it's been 18 days. And I've been at the store, making up for 15 days, saying it's taken me 15 days."
"Hand over the other dealer's sim, and no one accepts the sim of his house and doesn't activate."
"It took 15 days, and the waves in the province of the Valley were as strong as the Pythagoreltel, and I used this sim as a side to sim, plus sim, which is equal to simoftel, so it's going to divide 11 and a half months, and it's going to be 55K, for four stars, because it's 15 days missing."
"I just got the sim, and it's good to use it for a little while before I know it, so let me ask you, is it okay if I change the information to my name now?"
Used to use this sim to buy on the shoppe. use it very well. The network is good.
"The Shop supports slow-activated text messages and then waits to call and call to activate clients. The paper package only activates, so we don't know if we're going to be able to use it for a year."
"INTERNATIONAL, HOW DO I DIFFERENTLY DIFFERENT, NOT LIKE THE FACE OF FACE?"
"The price is right, the rate of the network is good and stable, but the coverage is not much, so it's less likely to be 3G or it can't be used in some places, as at home as an example:"
The sale hasn't been working all day.
I don't know if it's been for 12 months.
"Full information has been sent, but the shop does not send VAT bills."
"Sim has no signal, can't use it."
"A year's payment, a month's use check, no idea what's wrong with it?"
It's been less than 15 days since it's been solved. It's been taken a while.
"Son of a bitch store, sim can't use it."
"Sim we got the 18th April-2021 that sim activated a month ago, the network was fine four hours ago."
"The sim receiver has been active since October 2020, due to expire."
What's this all about?
How can you not activate the sim?
"Wave's unstable, wave's gone."
"It's been two days, I hope sim works well even though it's been gone for 10 days!!!"
I bought it off the shop. It's got services.
sim is registered to something about the bank.
"What do you mean, I just bought it?"
"Fast delivery, exactly as advertised after a year's check."
"Sim, we've been using it, so we don't know if it's stable. He's an enthusiastic shop owner, but the download network's a little slow, so he'll give it to a four-star shop."
"The network's pretty OK, but what if we just got the sim that had fe calling the loan asking questions? So four stars."
Why can't you activate the shop? No signal.
No trigger manuals.
Eight days should be for four.
That's why I'm here.
Sim's been activated for a month since the delivery.
Texted the shop for a long time.
"Using a new 4GB download laptop, it's been over 4GB for an hour."
Lost half a month.
"The sim is good, but it's gone four days."
The sim is activated almost a month away.
The Internet isn't good. It's unstable.
The shop's okay. It's only been a month. It's looking pretty good.
"The network's fine, not good."
"Good product, quick delivery."
Sim ok.
I'll buy you a...
"It's always boring, tiki."
fast delivered sp
It's temporary. Okay.
It's 17th of May.
"It's okay, it's okay. It's okay, it's okay, it's okay. It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay."
a bit lag
I don't know what it's all about.
stand by to activate
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
I'm fine.
Okay.
"Quality, delivery faster than expected."
"On the other hand, buy 10 black ones with six yellow ones."
It's good. It's good. It's good. I've got sweat.
"The mouse pads are soft, thick, and they're not moving, so they smell a little rubber, but they smell a little less with them."
"The product is very good, the delivery is extremely fast, the friendly shipper, the warm support shop."
The goods are much better than paper pads.
"Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go!"
"It's fast delivery, packaged well, product like description, beautiful, everything's okay."
"The delivery time is fast, I'll buy you a favor, thank you, Tiki!"
VOTE 5 FOR SHOP.
"The good stuff, the good price, the nice package, doesn't complain."
"The chance to buy three of them, the quality of the good stuff, the delivery on time!"
That's great!
Nice glasses.
sp quality similar to store description
It's all right.
Okay.
"It's a four-inch commercial, but it's actually only more than one millimeter, tweezer!"
It's not funny to put in a piece of 23x29. It's not funny.
"The product is exactly what it looks like, according to the price, quite satisfied."
"Nice leather, sure, tlcamr material feels good."
It's consistent with the price.
"No, no, no."
"We've got a signal, a radio battery with a radio, we've got to open it."
"Okay, ma'am."
Quality. Very quick delivery.
"The delivery is faster than the date and the delivery calls the five calls, and it leaves a message to the receiver, not a single cancel, so I'm very grateful to the U.K., and I'm very grateful to the stamp and seal, and the shell and the box are very new."
"Sorry, I've been looking for you and I have been working really hard and okay."
"Use very well, the cool press button. Set black tikis in white, but also nice. Everything is fine, worth money. However, Fn key function is slightly opposed to normal. Review after a temporary use date."
"The keyboard I've just bought hasn't bought in a month hasn't been able to use it on laptops and ipads, poor touch."
"Good keyboard, standard, good connection to hhemberg, nothing to complain about. Thks shop"
"It's been over a week, and yet there's nothing to complain about."
"The keyboard is very neat and very light, and it is handy to move. The typing key is very soft and noise-free, and it is almost blind to the delay, and it can customize the keys using the PlPC OPD software. The exception to yourself is that the remotepad is not sensitive. Well, notice that USB receiver is attached to the box (but rather than because in the battery tray), at first the beginning you open the box without any further notice that you keep looking...."
"The keyboard is good, there's checkpad, so it's convenient, Tiki delivers fast, friendly employees."
"I bought one, I saw it. It's okay. I bought another for two TVs."
"Received keyboards after three days of installation, queues such as advertisements, products with beautiful plastic, connected to telephones, fast computers, make this type with new keyboards, before pleasing eyes, waiting for a little ntn to evaluate more"
"Packages aren't very nice, but they're pretty sure, they're good, they're good, they're good, they're good, they're good, they're good, they're good, they're good, they're good, they're good, they're good, they're good."
"There's no mistake yet, but the key button is pretty good at the price, and in general, if you ever consider buying a keyboard to use for TV, then this might be a good choice to care about."
"This K400 is whatever it is, but the only notable one is the key of the method. The key of this line is quite hard, making it more difficult to type non-hand keys than the others."
"This is the second thing I bought, so it doesn't look as good as the previous version but it's OK."
"The keyboard is so good, Tiki makes quick delivery, I'm generally satisfied, I'm just going to buy a black keyboard before I buy a white screen, so who wants to buy yourself cheap and freeship."
"- It's a rainy day, but Tiki delivers as fast as two hours, the package has been delivered carefully, the quality is good."
"After a while of use, some of these feel like the following: short, soft press, too much office use, all right, pointless: thepad sometimes isn't so sensitive."
"Tiki closes the package carefully, delivered earlier than expected one day. The paper in the battery compartment needs to be removed before it is used. Just plug in the tip of the signal to SmartTV or the computer, turn on the switch behind the keyboard to be useful. Touchpad works properly. The left/ right mouse key has a shallow key drive, feel that it is not real. In return, the light keyboard should be able to hold it on or put it on the side of the keyboard when it is used. Freepad works properly within 5-7mmm. For Smart/VDVDVDLL, F1 F1 keys may be another F1+F1+N2+12+12+12+12+12+12). Additional hint for power extensions: The GUI+N+N+NN+N+N+N+NNN+NNNNA/NNNNNNNNNA (NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNA/NNNNNNNA/NA) option option option option option option option option option option option key option control option control option control option control option control option::: ""."
"Short keyboard, full function keys. Press OK, relative feedback is good. The keyboard is fine, multi-pointed, equivalent to on your laptop. Very pleased."
Ordered at noon in the afternoon delivered to super fast. There's a Bluetooth plug into the super fast-use television.
"Fast delivery, judge first step use: smooth keyboard, sensitivepad."
"The keyboard is very light, sensitive. Shortcut keys are very handy. Just plug in USB will be used immediately, especially SmartTV. Very encouraging for using SmartTV. TIBM delivers very carefully and quickly."
"Nice, sensitive keyboard, good connection, beautiful pattern"
It's a new use for a while. The product's okay.
"Keyboard: easy to use, simply plug in and run. When purchased with batteries attached to it, a fairly stable use is continuing to test for keyboard quality and battery time. Tiki: fast delivery, about 2/ 2 days is reached. Package carefully."
It's neat and it's handy.
Good.
"Good good good good good good good good, packed carefully, delivered quickly, quality good, durability must be used for a while."
"The quality of score 1020, the package is very careful, the keyboard is good, the battery is strong, the battery is long."
"This one buys and it's quite satisfying to spend the day. The keyboard is small and there's also sensors. Save space. Putting it in backpacks is much more convenient. but the keys are too close to each other, at first not used to the wrong hand, especially thearrows."
"Pack carefully, well within the price range, ear smoothing keys"
"I'm good with the money. I don't have any errors yet. I'm good with Sony X90E, plug & play, no need to install anything else. The keyboard keys work fine and right."
Good use of product with Sony Thebes 55X8050H
sp good
Good.
A quick connection over the end receives the web port. After using it can be kept in a keyboard without fear of losing it.
It's very convenient to have a keyboard integrating keyboard.
The design's a little bigger. It's a little better.
It's a product that's okay.
"The product's good, the delivery's faster than expected."
"Just received the package today, the first keyboard to feel the small, smooth hand, the sensitivepad, the sensitive button."
"Nice, good, log 2-0 is quality off the table."
Two longs.
Okay.
"The log line is good off the table, it's good for smart tv and the box TV."
You can install a log-lined mouse with a perfect combination when you're in the same bed that's working on your laptop.
"It's good, it's convenient, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good to take it and it's combined with other equipment."
Good compatible with tv Sony. Stable operation without error.
"The quality of the product, I wonder how many times I've bought it without adding a nickel."
"The keyboard is OK but the quality of tiki's services is too poor. When you're ordering newspapers after three days of delivery (about 12/13/8) but you're ordering them right now at August 19th. 2 days later, you'll have to report an old product. See, 29/8, but then you won't be able to deliver."
"It's not a great knock, it's convenient for smart tv, smart box, but it's more convenient for a ball rat to use a thumb than anpad."
The left mouse key's scratched out already! I don't know if it's new or new!
"It's fine, but the batteries are loose. The battery trays aren't sealed."
"A delay delivery, no notice of delay or any news for the customer, is no good now because it's not true for a two-hour delivery agreement."
What's wrong with that?
Good.
After half a month of use (only using a keyboard without apad) thepad is no longer active. offer to change!!!
Have any of the friends failed to type the number of smart TV SamSung web browsers?
"It's an inconvenience to plug its web into a machine, not a full Cid, so it shouldn't be used for an ipad."
"Nice, convenient design keyboard, soft press. However, the plastic around it is slightly oscillated!"
"In exchange for the goods, tiki and his department seem to be avoiding, pushing responsibility."
"All is OK except that the package is too sloppy, just covering one layer of glass paper, twisted box."
"Tiki delivers fast, product ok as introduction, thank you tiki"
"It's good, it's good, it's cheap, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good."
"It's easy to use, it's nice to hold a great screen."
"I'll buy it for you when I'm a little stuck in my phone with a watch to keep the data down. I'll do all sorts of things I can't do on ip8, but on ip14 I'll do okay."
"It's the silver that's wrong in pink, it's the back shop, it's the right color, it's the new product that's used, it's beautiful, it's the new form, it's the new form, it's not known yet but it's still evaluated five stars for different care services, it's okay to buy tiki for the first time, it's good for the long-term tiki."
"The anti-tag stamps have been torn. It's probably because of transportation or grips, so GHP has not been used yet, so it's not clear what's going on yet. The shipping shop is not very careful. There's nothing in the box to protect sp. But the quick delivery is still for shop five."
"The raw seals, the enthusiastic workers, the batteries that use are pretty good, suitable for high-performers and iios, low atropines are going to be limited to some of the applications in the software."
"Very small, fully functional as descriptions"
"I didn't know how to set it, so I texted it."
"All right, I like the way the store calls the video, and I'm just setting up all the time, and I'm going to keep supporting the shop."
"Nice watch, but it's impossible to call or receive notice. It's also very late."
"The original soft touch didn't connect the sound, it turns out there's two END connections, thanks to the hd shop very quickly."
"It's good to use it. It's long-term, fully functional."
AMA watch advertises the indicators of good events in general are good
It's a beautiful pink. It's always small. The female wear is the end of the date. Lover buys to watch the sport very well.
"Beautiful delivery very quickly, projected three days later, testing it, but we don't know how to install any more photos, thanks to further instructions from the shop."
Like qq ae shouldn't buy
"Quick delivery, product like pictures and descriptions."
"Celebrity Shop, responsibilities, satisfaction."
"It's a gift, it's an unknown quality, but it's an enthusiastic shop."
"It's a pleasure to have a nice woman with a firm hd shop call for backup. It's worth it, but it's worth it."
"The function as described, the battery is quite sustainable, will support the shop if there's any need to buy more, to pack well."
"The loud speaker, the watch *** code connection, is that you can listen to the comfortable music on the clock, the touch is also very sensitive."
"Pin's good, Shop's gone."
"It's a gift, but the store's very enthusiastic."
"It's a gift, it's a very warm shop."
"All right, we're good. All right, let's put your hands up, see if it's still slow now, but the money you're buying is fine."
"It's a neat little watch that suits you small-handed friends, quality OK, previous counsel shop and then very enthusiastic purchases."
I like this color. It's good to use it. It's good to buy it. It feels better than it's supposed to be.
"Small and tight, running healthy monitors. Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay."
I don't know.
"It's been spent for over a month, quality clocks are good for the price, stores are good for the service."
"Fast, beautiful, but unreported delivery from anywhere."
I got gift cards in the box.
"This one's got a sim on it, man."
It's very convenient to watch your health.
Cannot initialise Evolution's mail component.
It's not connected to the phone yet.
Thank you very much.
Enforced helpers take good care of themselves.
"I haven't tried it yet, but the way the package is satisfied, delivers the right specimen."
"With a quick delivery, a beautiful form, and a function, it's still experiencing more."
"It's been 10 days, it's good, it'll go back to the shop if you need to buy something."
"Okay, nice stuff. We're gonna have to wait a while."
"Buying when sate is discounted and transportation costs, neat and expensive."
"Quick delivery shop, well packed, good sp within range"
"Good use of products, convenient at work."
"I've been trying to buy a job so many times now that I've made two bad choices that no children have ever been able to replace so many for so many reasons that I didn't change my mind. Good luck buying something so far as I can afford to be pregnant, I bought it so that I can make a mistake for two more than I've ever been able to buy it before."
Good?
It's a beautiful pattern that fades the moon in this exchange. Okay.
I've spent it for a while. I'm satisfied with this watch.
Beautiful?
"Buy one for sale. Make a profit, in general."
"Nice model, fair price."
The clock's good. lt's easy to use. The battery's about three days away.
"Beautiful pattern, quick delivery, five stars."
This isn't a timer.
"It's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good."
Sure.
The clock is fine.

"It's a three-day run-of-the-mill store that's been in the country, creating a 22-06 return order until April 4,07, after repeated messages, texting with tiki says the dealer is not responsible, asking me to fire 350k in exchange for new sp."
"For others, I don't know how much I value my product."
"Fast delivery, neat installation instructions. High blood pressure and heart rate when you can't measure it, you can't measure it, you can't measure it, you can't measure it, you can't measure it, you can't measure it, you can't measure it, you can't measure it, you can't measure it, you can't measure it, you can't measure it."
"Look at the good looks, but the clock has two little cuts, no shadows."
"We need to change the machine. There's no trace, but the wire's scratched. The monitor's got a dot."
"The product's okay, it's a five-star model, it's a nice touch interface, but the box's a little old. Hopefully, it's a little bit off."
"I've bought two, I've been using them for 11 months."
"The beautiful product, every OKie function, but the battery that's spent just one day without much use, the battery doesn't match its content, or the battery fails?"
"This product doesn't get a message from any of you, outlook, ms teams. It doesn't meet your needs. It's kind of sad."
"The next day, the number of steps to remove the blood pressure automatically and the other indicators that measure the battery will soon be connected to the phone and it will not be summed up the next time you find another company."
Connecting to iPhone 14promax is not working.
I'll send you an error clock.
The product's no good compared to the price.
"It's a nice date, but it's connected to a phone that has no instructions, so it's still not connected. The quality of the use is new to us."
"My watch doesn't have a qr code, my shop can guide you in how to use it."
"I've got the package, I haven't even installed the message feature to the phone, I've got the supply store, I've got the DD!"
Why can't the clock be connected to the dt?
"It's a little hard to adjust without any Vietnamese, but the weather's not right, the battery's fast, it's not what it's supposed to be."
Fine package the following judge product
"It's nice, but it's not connected to the dt."
Shared it for me how to reinstall the time
I don't know how to set the time.
Okay.

"Batteries don't last 24 hours, they don't work now."
It's nice to deliver fast
How do I use it? I turn it on. I don't see it.
The water tolerance is not high yet.
"Error product, long-term maintenance."
Use no visual problems yet. OK.
Didn't approve of receiving the product.
Good quality.
It's not good for you.
It's not as good as it looks.
May oke sack
It's okay.
The original package of the product is boring.
"Very good, delivery by 12 p.m."
"It's a perfect keyboard, it's a nice little one."
"Type in sensitively, keyboards are narrower than they think they are, the width is the size of a laser. With an amplphone, they have to be added to an app type in their own language."
"Beautiful weldings, well-known firms, multi-connected keyboards, but neither purchases can be used, fast innovations, good solutions."
I don't know.
"The blue one is very nice. The front part of the skin is not easy to get dirty, but the surface of the screen is soft, so when you use it, it's easy to get dirty, but it's hard to clean. The back edge of the plastic, the handles are just backwards at the aluminum edge, not on the screen, and the holes are so beautiful, but the power and the tones that go up are so hard to hit, and the dust is not so heavy or so heavy."
"A lot of distorted boxes, they've lost their virginity to the authentics."
"I've got black, but I've got a little bit of yellow, and I don't think quality is worth the price."
That's fine.
"Use it for 2-3 computers at the same time very convenient and rapidly switch, which takes about a second to convert the machine twice and twice to click the mouse button."
"Very well. Nice figure. I'm sorry, but there's no silent toe so the mouse clicks are a bit loud. Nine-tenths."
"Rats have the right pattern, new."
Pleased by the various functions of the custom
Rats use sensitive delivery quick package kidney load
Good.
Deluxe
It's been over a year.
The mouse used it and still sent it to the client.
"The mouse has been broken, the sly shop by pasting the stamps is the seal of the store, and you are not careful, or you may be used by the store."
I can't connect the keyboard to the computer via Bluetooth. Please do me a favor.
"I bought it for 840k. If we're going to buy another one, we're going to go down to 1.5."
It's a wonderful quality of the new infinite spin.
"It's a little expensive. A third of the time, that makes sense. It's a little loud."
Four months after error!!!
Right on the line.
"The company itself, it's nice, it's Gear4, which, since it's used, only buys from the company."
That's great for the product.
"Price and quality. Okay, guys."
Nice goods.

The product's small. It doesn't need an external source. It's a box shell that looks good.
Use it fine. Sensitivity
I've bought it twice. It's a really good visual device. It's a lot of money.
"It's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good."
"Used a week, pretty smooth."
It's very convenient.
Good stuff.
"Slow delivery, wait for the throat."
"Look at the substance but the clean price compared to a number of lines, no two screens at a time."
"There's a power leak, so consider it when you buy it."
"It's the right model, it's packed carefully."
"Pack it up separately, quality goods that are too good."
"Ugreen's main product, which is very firm, the joints are very stable, not like cheap products."
"The hull of the lift is exactly the same as the 79K, but the bass that takes it to the table is much better, the quality clamps, the iPad Pro 12.9 clips."
"Good quality, nice, easy to use."
"Hard-core, can handle the galaxy tab."
The clamp is definitely not afraid to crash the machine
"It's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good."
good product
"The price is solid, just like the ad, the metal can never go bad, it can't go away, but the head needs to change, the stickyness and the hardness of the rack is fine."
"I opened the first one to use, and I lost my grip very firmly (from the spring in the clip) to the design, and it was nice to look at (but it was small)."
"It's a very thoughtful store, it's just not used yet, but it's very solid, at first it's very, very OK."
It's a good offer. No phone rings. It's easy to use.
"It's solid and classy, but it's the camera clip. It's not very nice. It's gotta be nice. It's gotta be nice."
Strong iron clamps. nice. to deliver all accessories. shop to answer messages quickly and instructions to use very passionately
"It's very easy to use, it's very convenient to buy things quickly, it's very much fun at the shop."
"OK clamps are good, very sure, easy to control as you like, use your strength and go back to support the shop."
It's a solid price. It's easy to adjust. It's a good product. Okay.
"It's nice, it's the same, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good."
"A sure price, a lot of arm support."
"The pattern looks exactly the same, very certain, and the clip is slightly scratchy because it's black."
Ace should buy sd and experience solid product.
Okay.
"Hold the phone steady, quick delivery shop, well packed, I'll back you up."
"Main support, easy to use, good quality at the price, fast delivery, very good service, both good products and services please you."

It's all right. It's all right. It's all right. It's all right. It's all right.

The product is better than expected. It's very satisfying.

"The product's pretty good, there's some angle that can't handle the phone, so it's a slight curve that's going to be better, and it's packed very carefully, and it's going to deliver fast."
"The product is extremely bad, and I feel good, so I believe in buying it, and it turns out it's all virtual, sp looks positive, but it's not going to hold it down, it's going to help people not buy it."
"The quality product, minus the iphone 14 promax, because it's heavier than other phones."
"The top one's hard, but the bottom one's soft, the weight's bad."
Quick delivery but the old product and the catch edge are broken
"Just got the product, but the head is oxidized... and the price is very weak..."
Bad. I can't use it. It's loose and can't handle a note nine.
Fine.
"Wrong delivery, offer to return the goods. What's the price of the cell phone, radius?"
"It's pretty okay. The wire's solid, so the phone's not shaking, but the wire's a little short. If it's a little bit longer, would it be more comfortable?"
It's not broken. It's a perfect weight.
"It's too bad. Buy it and be played. No, you should buy it."
It's not a hard thing to use.
"It's kind of tight-wired, tight-knit butt-splitting."
"Quick delivery, rusted goods, a little weak..."
"A tablepin's got to be a little weak, so his phone's going down all the time."
"It's weak, it's okay, it's okay."
"Even though you're putting your phone in a bit of a shake, it's good enough for you."
"It's not a hard cross, it's not a hard cross."
Good price.
You can't study with her forever.
"It's hard to use, it's not very flexible, it's normal."
"It's too weak, it's too heavy, it's kind of gnarly."
That's good.
good use
The price of weakness can't help the phone.
"The tail's weak, the candy's in or out."
"All right, baby, are you okay with the ice cream?"
too weak
I don't know.
Fine.
"The product is solid, light, easy to assemble, it adjusts the slope for the laptop"
"Easy-knit, light, classy."
Okay.
Good.
The package product is very careful; it feels good when using thy product well compared to the price; and thy unacquainted writing isn't as round and beautiful as other high-priced products; in general it's okay at this price.
"The long-term delivery, I'm sure, has been so long since I chose to deliver it, ordered from Monday, which is kind of distorted, but it doesn't matter because the package is so thick that I don't have to be afraid of what's inside."
"The delivery shop is extremely fast. The machine is nice and easy to use, smoothed with pens, but there's no link with the laptop that makes you look too new, but in general it's okay and should be bought."
Use it to learn how to draw or play osu all right. 1 meter long USB is short for PC users. The pen is pretty fast after a week of use but there are three available instead.
"Nice design, I'm not used to it yet."
"The quality used like review, but if you're a big guy like yourself, you should buy something a little bigger, it's comfortable. You're getting used to it a little bit longer, you'll be fine, even if it's a little bit smaller."
It's a nice drawing board.
"Fast delivery, even though it takes time to get used to it, is worth five seconds of quality and prestige."
"Good package, quick delivery, unknown quality. Small table."
"It's okay, it's quick delivery, it's the first time, so it's kind of weird, thanks to the shop."
"With good use, tiki delivers not so fast because the product from Hnship comes in, it's kind of lame, but it's generally pleasing."
"Good product, quick delivery."
The drawing board is really good to draw and play osu!
"Let's try it. All right, let's hope it's a long one."
Convenient
"Good product, quick delivery."
"Nice, cool table. <i>Hang on a little bit.</i> <i>I hope I can use a lot of it.</i>"
"It's good. It's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good."
It's pretty good.

"The machine's very smooth, very well wrapped."
"Although we're trying to figure out how to use it, it's pretty good."
"Fast delivery, package is carefully packed, wacom is very much interested."

"Just received every morning, packaged and beautiful goods, but one ear on the right is squeamish and the sound is interrupted."
"It's a beautiful product, but it's on one side, and it's on the other side, and it's in contact with sales and it's in exchange."
"Sound quality is fine. There is a delay, cannot be used to play games"
"It's been over a week since it's been charged, and please show me how to pay for it."
"It's got a lot of scratch on it, it looks like it's old."
The ear can only hear one side.
It's okay. It's a broken ear. You can't buy it for someone else.
"The battery's too weak, the dk is better, the battery's better."

It's not that tight. It's easy to fall when you're in a good mood.
The quality of hearing is normal.
It's not a good earpiece.
"I just got a package, and after 30 minutes of plugging, I saw this shell with a crack in my head, and I just got really satisfied with the look of the product, and there was a shock, and the crack came out when I didn't have time to unplug it, and the design was so good, the ear quality was fine at the price, but the material was too bad, and the material had not been used, and it was broken, and I hope that the supplier and Tiki gave the idea for this case."
"The product's okay, it's nice, it's quality, but the delivery product is broken, although it doesn't matter."
"The quality of the product is bad. I've had two times to send back Tiki because of my error, now I regret that at the first time (in the first seven days) I should have offered money to buy another product. Both times failed to send a signal on either side of my ear (which is on the right), although I've found every way, I've used all my devices. Now Tiki's announced that the product has been preserved, all of it and will be sent again."
"The earpiece is so beautiful, it's all right, Tiki delivers quickly, you're generally happy about the product, and the pink is nice, everybody, the cute retro type."
"When you're done buying about a broken ear, you're really pretty, but it's too bad."
"Good sound, good battery, good product."
"Tiki delivered so quickly, I thought it was the new 8th."
"I used to feel good. The way the store looks good, so I'm going to support the long shop."
"Fast delivery, wait a few days and there'll be a deeper review, the initial sum is quite OK, but the actual color is not as beautiful as the color in the image."
"Beautiful, tiny, small, small, small-handed bass sound, when the ears are removed, the response to the music stops for a moment."
"You're going to faint, you're going to hold your hand, you're going to sound good, you're going to feel a sense of cx, you're going to hunt down the flash sate today cheaply."
"It's very nice to catch a PCP, both laptops and iphones. It's very fine. It's a very beautiful form of retro code. It's very beautiful."
"I've just got a bug in my earphone, a policy for exchange as well as a QQ, but the shop is changing in 24 hours when the product's off, and tiki's off, man."
"Sound, battery, two o'clock."
"Good use, rewarding image."
"Pink is cute, sounds good, earpieces are smooth, no pain."
"It's beautiful, it's cute, it's nice, it's rice money, it's beautiful."
"The product is beautiful, the sound is clear, it's probably not familiar, it's a bit difficult to control, the delivery's pretty fast, the delivery's intact."
It's good. It's pretty warm. It's okay. I don't know if the batteries are going to work.
"It's very late, it's full of two headsets, and now there's only one left."
"Nice design like a bad connection, got a buffalo battery."
Nice. I don't know how good it is yet.
"It's okay, but it's not worth it, it's just for the sake of the beauty, the microphone shrinks, buys it just for virtual music, it's okay."
"It's easy to connect, it sounds stable, it's using a little more time to see how it's going to work."
It's a mistake. One of you can't hear me.
"I can only hear one side, the Shop supports myself with another."
"An ear that doesn't charge the batteries, the warranty, tiki."
"The product's using OK, the beautiful pattern, it's just a day off, so we don't know how long it's going to last."
There's no problem with buying it for ny.
"And there's no way to charge even if we switch 340 of the same kind, it's really annoying to see this happen."
"Quick delivery, well packed. The quality's fine."
"It's only been a month. I can't hear you, hazz."
"The purchase only hears one ear, has been contacted by support without any response."
We can't charge the battery. The battery's still down.
"It's not what I expected. I spent an hour off the battery, so I gave it back to the house and I gave it back."
"It's beautiful, it's small, it's just heard once, if it's okay after a week, it'll buy more as a gift."
I got it yesterday. I'm fine with it.
The new product that's been using for over two months has failed.
"I'm using it, but sometimes it doesn't sound good, or it's cut off in my ear."
Want to find information sell to ask hddd without a sdt. Sp only has a mid-size word that doesn't have a root
"Headsets only charge one side, the other side doesn't charge."
Okay.
Okay.
"Now, if you're going to get Bluetooth..."
One earpiece failed to connect at no time.
"Listen to good music. If you hear me, you'll be delayed for about two hours."
"Nice ear, nice bass."
"The product is pretty sure, the sound sounds good compared to the price range."
"sp dep, retro, amicable or... but tall."
Nice goods.
"The battery's a little weak, so it's not perfect."
It's a nice look. The delivery's a little slow.
Broken shell etcvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv
The price is too high for quality.
One ear can't hear.
The earpiece's okay. It's on the line.
We're running out of batteries.
It's nice. It's okay.
"Good sound, fast Bluetooth capture."
"Nice hearing, good hearing, favoring the belly."
It's a bit of a scratchy shell.

"The handle is smooth, it's clean, it's clean, but the tip is a little rough in the pocket, and if it's not tight, and the blue is a little bit more pale than the one we're using, and at a higher price than the one we're using, we're saying if we can improve sp, we're going to introduce our support."
"I just bought it, and when I can't use it, I can't get my skin torn off, and I'm really disappointed."
It's tough to use three days of fake skin bumps.
use short break time
"The product looks pretty old, doesn't look good!!!"
The correct quality of the shocks you've been using for two months is generally good.
"The speaker's limited because of the leaks on top and the charge site is also the same thing, but it's pretty good."
I'm not sure I'm disappointed in plastic.
Disillusionment... doesn't match the price.
Quality fine at sale price
"OK, I got it. I haven't installed it yet."
"The design has a very good plastic in the four corners, and it's a good idea to show you the ad, and they don't see the hole in it, and actually, they've made a hole in it, and it's about them, and it's about me, and it's good to see this, and I don't worry about the speaker."
"The sale of broken goods to the guests, opening the box with mold and breaking the edge of the border, the business of jerking off."
"The fake leather plastic says it should be marked as skin-colored plastic, who on the web has written only information that ""the back of the skin"" is ""fuck!"" Don't buy plastic at a price like this!"
"Open up the dirty, newly installed product that's broken in four corners, and offer to change the product to the right quality."
"I've got a back product for OECD/SEFOF, but the shop delivers an OECD X/Xs."
I'm the only one who's gonna tear it apart. The two corners below the store. Let's see if we can trade it back with it.
"The surface of the skin is firm in hand, the corner of the plastic shocks, and the base is thick, and it's thicker than a woman, but it's because you like the simplicity and the dirt that you have to buy."
"The product's oki, which is new to use so we can't evaluate the quality of the product."
"Beautiful blue, cute, healthy skin. See the quality you're buying at 199K."
Okay.
"The delivery time is pretty fast, the product matches the price of money, the leather back should hold steady your hand and shockproof when you crash, impact."
Nice product fits the iPhone 12. Soft skin.
The delivery wasn't the right product. The iPhone 8plus matrix delivered xsmax.
"Nice back, but the black part doesn't look good and old."
It's okay to have four rough views.
Nice back.
Thank you.
"It's okay, it's like the image has information, it doesn't measure the quality."
"Right delivery form, fast delivery."
"The product's pretty good compared to the price, the delivery's quick."
Celebrity Shop
"It looks like a sky market, material's not as good as description, it's not worth the money!"
Give me the wrong cover. Put it in the width.
"The plastic tip of the four corners was a bit dirty, the skin was fine, the tightness of the hand."
"It's a touchable product, but it's a bit slippery, fast delivery, beautiful design."
"However, the skin on the border is uncertain, so long is easy to tear."
Nice.
Use it fine.
Sp is as good as it looks.
"Dep, go inside. Go ahead and buy it."
Very beautiful & sure
Good quality.
"Nice cave, should buy"

It's beautiful. It's soft.
"Nice back use. Okay, it's a little sour."
"It's beautiful, it's sharp, it's like a photo of a shop, it's delivered on time - it's satisfied."
The camera's too hmmmmmmmmm.
"Nice, but I got the wrong one. How about 11 pros?"
It's beautiful.
"It's a great product, right for the price you're offering."
"Very pleased, very smooth."
Quality is fine.
The mic's under the hood. It's so disappointing.
Good.
"All right, good use."
"The Shop is extremely supportive, so you should buy it here."
"Just got it from the shop, which is soft, easy to build. It's exactly the same, for shop five."
I'm sending the wrong stuff. Buying my back to IP7 but sending it to IP5.
Cam on the shop.
Cam on the shop.
"Nice, good quality."
"It's good, it's good, it's good, it's good."
"It's returned, as expected."
Nice goods.
"I put the base to ip11, black again delivers the 12 green mossa,"
"It's nice, it's good."
"The delivery was faster than expected, and as for the cargo, I felt 95 percent approval."
Sombe ok
"Cam's security is a little thin, so it's still easy to scratch a camera."
"Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no."
This product isn't as good as money!
"Yeah, sure."
I'm fine.
Okay.
"It's plastic, it's super beautiful."
"Beautiful, yes."
Nice to use very much
"It's okay, it's hard."
Nice.
"Well, that's normal."
It's beautiful.
It's okay.

Good product.
"Okay, but it's a little expensive."
Good.

It's not as beautiful as I'm described as being a little disappointed.
It's too expensive.

"I'm disappointed, the box is distorted, the clock can't be used for money."
Very pleased.
Good.
Good product.
"Fast delivery, color exchange, but it was quick, easy to use, big, light screens, good volume calls, and many of the functions that I didn't experience, and if I let the clock go on and on, it was a little too fast."
"Seeing how a lot of customers evaluated good stores, they decided to buy two for themselves and their sweethearts for 8/3:3, and they're off the table because they're good, they're better off with cheap, they're sending HDSDs, and they're calling for support."
"I got the forms, I got the blanks, I got the black kko tiki, I got the shop, I got the white wire."
"Sp is right for the description. <i>Grads are very soft.</i> <i>Engs are very loose.</i> <i>We're waiting for an installation for a new test to experience quality.</i> <i>In the beginning, take the package, hold the package in your hand very well.</i> <i>All right.</i>"
"It's a nice, multi-tasking watch that's good for the price."
"The watch was beautiful, the battery was good, the sound was me and in, the shop owner was too prestigious, I got the black wire, I changed the wire very simply."
"The watch is fine, the model is nice, the shop is asking if there's a replacement wire, and your kid's playing with it, and he's cutting the wire."
"Put it on my ass, but for this price I don't ask for anything else, I don't know if it's going to last long, but the shop is quite passionate, and I can change the background, and I'm going to pack it carefully, and I'm going to put it the next day."
"Set up four to make a gift for the customer, fast delivery, freeship, raw seal, which has passed and will be OK."
"The straps are in the wrong color, they're connected to the shop, they're positive responses, they're given the right color."
Good sustainable material delivers fast and hard to sync the data
"The first day's use, but it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, the battery's fine, the battery's unchecked, but it's less than one and a half days."
It's a nice watch. It's a little bigger than the girl's. The quality is not yet known.
"I got a gift card for 50k cad, asked how to get the cad."
"Great design, beautiful model, dedicated vendor, detailed instructions, in line with regular client interest in health."
"The clock was good for men, looking a little rough, running pretty well, the store was wrong, but processing very well, sent another wire back to them."
I've been going through it for a while before I get the right idea.
"The same white S2 has a rating, and it's divided into two different reviews, so we're going to write off the store, and hopefully next time we're going to get a discount."
"The box outside tiki gets wet, the water is a little wet inside, and it's a little bit unsatisfactory with the other one, and there's no idea."
"There's a problem with starting a text to ask the shop, the answer shop!"
"It's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's for your birthday."
"Package received, quickly packed, very pleased."
The good product has been backed up with a change of rope.
"The price was reasonable, the motivation was to go for a diet."
"The fast delivery store, packing needs kidneys, but it's a little awkward to install, but the instructor is very enthusiastic, and he's going to support the shop again."
"Supporting Good Clients, Beautiful Supplies"
Thanks for your enthusiastic support.
"Nice watch, dedicated employees, serving well-ranged customers."
It's a pleasure. It's a good one.
Quick delivery. Sp looks like a picture.
Why did you give me a watch that didn't have a wire?
"Fast delivery, quality waiting to be experienced."
"The watch bought over a week before we evaluated it. The quality of it is OK, the delivery is well packed, so buy it for shop five."
"Happy, product ok, passionate guide"
Quality fits the price.
"The clock is good, the clock is bigger than planned, it's not very fashionable."
Convenient product. sp is exactly the right one to buy
The clock is very convenient. A lot of what you need for your health is worth buying.
Take care of good customers.
"Buying one for you and one for adults should get a pretty good discount, very pleased with the way the store works."
good product soft value is easy to use
The perfect fashion profile.
"Beautiful goods, prestigious shops, fast delivery."
It's a beautiful product. It's a long one to evaluate.
It's good as advertised.
"I don't know what you're buying. If you're using it for phone calls, it's only been for almost two days. It's not fun."
Nice delivery product.
Okay.
The product's oki.
"The relative quality, the reasonable price"
"Warm shop support, quick delivery. big watch face but his style"
"Quick delivery, good back-up shop."

You're my type.
I'd like that.
The battery's only been in two days. It's been tested many times. It's taken a little longer.
"I'm afraid if you're reading comment, don't buy this store. It's all wrong. When you buy it, you're gonna have to call it, and then you're gonna shut it down, and then you're gonna send it back and you're gonna tell him to pay for it, and then you're gonna keep in touch with everything that's going on."
"I buy the product and the white straps, and when I deliver the product, it's black and white I want to change it back to the right color to give it to you."
"sf delivered quickly, but no instructions to install and use English should make it difficult for users, small applications, short-term batteries"
"You buy the white wire, you deliver the black wire."
"Okay, can we change the black straps?"
Clock's fine; I need to get the bill to unlock the lock because I forgot my password.
"The delivery wasn't on time, the phone connection, the phone, the music, it wasn't on."
Use sensors that are not easy to use
Load all TFits in but in search of the device not found
It's too bad. It's too fast.
"The bluetool connects weakly, or lost, even eight meters away."
Can't feel it.
The delivery's missing. It's not wired.
"Hanging a goat's head for meat, putting a sort of delivery, price is not worth it."
"The device is quite fine compared to the price, easily connected to telephones, fast delivery, and carefully packed."
"Two-hour delivery, good connection with all the accessories, which takes time."
It's okay. It's a commercial.
"If you need a smooth connection quality that's perfect, you shouldn't pick one of these."
"The initial quality was good, using stables that were quite good at the right price compared to whether it was a very fast Bluetooth signal, which was a quick test for cross-frequency, a very good sound quality."
"The product is so good, it's so sudden because of the price. I hear unsurpassed through my skullcliff ear and attach it to this. It's really not that different."
Beautiful little grapes quickly connected the loud sound obviously have a charge that's always worth buying the strength that Saigon has just been about a year and it's OK.
"The good stuff, when it comes to charging once a day, spends a little bit of it three days, doesn't run out of batteries -- doesn't work out the way it's going to work."
"It's been a long time since I've been on the phone directly, especially when I'm driving, and now I'm buying this product, and I'm going to put it on my collar, and it's a good sound, quick catch, there's a call coming in English, and whoever's using a wire should buy this."
"The quality of sound doesn't change, it's possible to get a phone call, it's quite pleased with the product."
"Deal 6k of tiki. get the product after 2 days, have boxes, full charge, easy to use, fast charge. sounds loud, clear like bt, not down quality."
"I connect two meters away from a good and stable signal, which sounds really OK, like I'm going to put it directly, and I'm going to have this little beep of playing, and I'm going to turn it off, and I'm going to hear the beeps, and I'm going to get a full hour, and I'm going to have a 90 percent capacity, and I'm going to have about two and a half hours, and I'm going to be happy."
"The device works well. The device has tried on various connections: the phone, the tablet, Windows, Mac OS, both for a good connection. The string that moves out to jack the lotus to attach the imply. Putting in an amply filtering sound out or outside the speaker. If the audio is passed on with this device and the vga on the slide, it will not match the image because it has a delay. With a 78K device, that would be too much satisfaction."
"Places two sets, shortest, full function, releases sound as standard as using jack. Only two card buttons are upside down, but it doesn't really matter."
"Very pleased about the product, which has been spent for three days, should be reviewed for you: 1. Image: very nice, light, simple product, just as big as one finger, and in the back so I'm going to take it to the collar so that when I need to talk to you quickly, the sound quality of my ear doesn't change. (Laughter)"
"The sound doesn't change, but it's only for earphones that have microphones that only use microphones that can't be used on headphones."
"Well-connected goods, smooth music, unblowed jack plugs, sure enough, sound quality is no different than a direct ear plug to the phone, I buy 30 minutes without charge, the battery's still dead, the microphone's still talking, the audio's still on the phone."
"It looks good. It's a little expensive, but it's also a five-second story of how long it is, Ps: a little bit of a scratch."
"Get the shit out of it, everything's stable, it's clean, it's loud, it's loud, it's clear."
Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
"Yeah, coupled with earphones that sound good. Okay, cheap. Sounded better than the current blues earpieces on the market."
"Just received the goods, using ip to use full features, connecting to ip will show battery information from the converter, combined with Sony's extra bas ear is very warm... very fond of this product, using batteries as long as you don't know, but at first it's too good."
"It's a great use. It's a lot of prescribing for both hearing ears and speakers, but it's a great use of blues, or it's a great deal of sp."
"Great negative, sounds like plugging into the phone, connected pretty far away."
"The product responds properly to the request for blues converting, pair is good for all the equipment you try, the battery is fine, but it's easy to be sly or out of waves if you put it in a small position, but if you put it in the right way, it's okay."
"Actually, I'm in need of a MPD earpiece, and when I'm online, I don't like what's going on, and what's going on is that it's going to cost 400K to the low price, and the low cost of the phone doesn't know the quality, and this is the perfect combination for someone who already has a hearing ear and wants to turn it into an ear, the quality of sound that's going to be okay."
"I bought four months of R, which is a great stereo to play games, which is definitely plastic, which is pretty light to put on clothes, which is good for a long time, so I'm going to buy something new like that."
"The package failed to connect. Oh, my God. I just bought two, but I only used one."
"I'm buying a 1. The form + light and tight plastic device, the interactive button + professional cdesign colors. + listen to music via bluethoot, fast connection, steady plus 5-7 meters distance, have a wall about 2 m plus microphone out and adaGN device that comes in handy. The amount of battery +3h is equal to 1.20 degrees plus 4.5 degrees plus Alt, but the whole source of sx is at MM and OEM."
"Pack it well, deliver it quickly, catch the wave, and the battery will be used to figure it out."
It's good. It's good. It's good. It's good.
"Come on, let's go, let's go, let's go! Let's go, let's go, let's go!"
"I've got the goods, I've got the tecks. Okay, I've got the goods, I've got the goods, I've got the goods, I've got the goods, I've got the goods, I've got the goods, I've got the goods, I've got the goods, I've got the goods, I've got the time."
"The negative's fine, the battery's long enough, the battery's fast enough."
"Good connection, loud audio play, at least distinguish LR"
"Transportation's pretty fast, sound quality's fine."
"The connection is good, it's about 10 meters if there's an obstacle. Auto cut off when the battery is full, read the connection/unconnected, read the caller."
"Stability, battery use all day, good price, chat luong am bar tot"
"Listen to me loud and clear, I don't know how long I've been listening to music."
"Okay, well, the battery's connected fast, and we'll see what we can do later."
"It's a beautiful product, and most of the batteries are noticeable in English. Pin is fine, listen to good music, especially the bass is quite deep."
"We've just received the package, we've got the same ear, we've got the same ear, we've got the best, we've got the right time, let's see how we can be more specific!"
Good product.
"I just got the product today, the sound quality of the device is very good, obviously, clean, I don't know how long it is, I don't know how long it is, but the quality of the sound is good so I support five stars."
Connection ok. Connect to fast television. Listen to me.
It's a beautiful fashion product.
"It's very convenient, but when you plug in a computer, the only way out is to hear a speaker."
Good.
Okay.
"It's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good."
"Good connection, very much with the product."
Very convenient.

"Yeah, that's great. That's really good stuff."
"All right, let's pack the good stuff. Okay, it's a good deal. Okay, it's a good deal."
Fine at the price of money.
"Fast delivery product, new use feel good, fast connection, sound when it's not delayed, press keys are a little hard but it feels good."
"Use the battery for more than three hours, and in this price, there's no need to ask for more than that. The shop is fast."
"Four hours straight... five meters at a time, it sounds good. The quality is not different from the originals are good products at the price."
Good.
Good.
An elephant.
It's good. It's good. It's good.
Very convenient.
This one's pretty cool.
"Batteries are weak, we need constant plugs."
Good service.
"The device is fast connected to the battery phone, which uses about three hours."
Wrong rat. Okay.
"The package is exactly the way it looks, the battery's been charged for 30 minutes, listening to music for four hours."
It's very appropriate.
Quick delivery.
"As good as you can expect, tiki delivers as quickly as possible and packages."
Okay. Standard row.

"It's a great product, but I don't know how strong it is."
Okay.
Thank you very much.
"It's very quick to get the goods, use them very well, as described."
"It's only been three days, but the battery's been on for a long time."
normal row
"It's pretty good, it's sensitive, it's eating! I don't know if it's sustainable, but whatever feels pretty good."
"Cheap, fine."
Sp ok
Good.
"I got to say, it's like ear plugs. There's nothing to talk about."
OK.
this converter uses very well the standard connection quality is far away
Okay.
Okay. Nine-tenths is going down the battery. It's going to sound good.
Okay.
"I've got two longs. I've got the shoulders, I've got the corals, I've got the guts, I've got four, I've got the batteries."
"It's good at the price, it's good at the money, it's over, why are you making so much arrests?"
Okay.
"It doesn't matter how you buy it, it won't be necessary to buy it."
It's good. It's good. It's good.
fast transport good use
Good.
"It's very useful to be able to make earpieces into earphones, wood speakers often turn into speakerphones, without a wire connection."
"Pretty handy products, light weights, just about the size of the pen cap, pretty good time for the battery to come back up fast and maybe charge it both using"
Good.
"So that idle doesn't use about three, four days, and there's still batteries to keep going."
"Fair price, long term use, no negative noise, no significant delay, good activity within a 10-foot radius without interference."
Please advise yourself to buy a Mic sound converter with a wire to a wireless device.
The product is exactly like advertising. It's so beautiful at a price.
Connection sounds pretty good.
"I'll buy you two to use. Okay, if the product comes with a toad charge, it's better."
"It's okay, it's not bad, it sounds good, it's good, it's good, it's worth it."
"Okay, listen to about two and a half hours of battery failure."
"Good products at a price range, stable. Sound is acceptable."
"The product quality's pretty good for the price, the package's tight, the delivery's fast."
The product fits the delivery quickly.
It's a pleasure. It's a pleasure.
"THE FACE OF THE SERIAL, DIFFERENT DIFFERENTS, AND THE DIFFERENT FAIRS."
"Use it well, connect quickly, sound is acceptable, Se continues to support tiki."
"Sound sounds good, warm bass, long-term batteries exactly match the price."
Good. Okay. Good.
"INTERVIECTIONS, INCREASIONS OF THE CHALLENGE, INSTRUCTION OF THE DIFFERENT SERVED"
The quality of sound changes to the device is quite good compared to the price range
"Sounds good, use it long, deliver on time, use a lot of equipment."
It's better than the price.
Okay.
"The sound's fine, the battery's good, the quality's good, the battery's good, the sound's good."
"The product is going to be OK, listening to quality music is no different than plugging in earpieces."
The Shop sent me without an earpiece. I don't have an earpiece.
"Good sound conversion, sound quality sounds good, light product."
This could make a remote camera with a camera.
"I'm very good at making good sounds, and I'm very good at recording them. I'm good at hearing them, I'm good at them, I'm good at them, I'm good at them, I'm good at them, I'm good at them, I'm good at them, I'm good at them, I'm good at them, I'm good at them, I'm good at them, I'm good at them, I'm good at them, I'm good at them."
Okay.
"Good quality, smarttv football night is fine."
"It's light, it's strong, it's no different than a nine-and-a-half wire."
Sounds pretty good.pin's good. That's generally good at the price range.
"It's a neat product, it's a sound quality, it's a small product, it should be purchased."
"The sound is loud and clear, both sides."
The product has a good quality compared to the price.
"Well, the packaged product is careful, quality as advertised."
"The product's the right quality, but the delivery wait's a little long."
It's too cheap to write 50 characters.
"Let me ask you, if I order now, how long will it take?"
It's good. It's good. It's good. It's good.
"But I don't know how tough it is, it's pretty good. It's not very loud."
IT'S POSSIENT TO EXACTLY LIVING TO EXPLAIN THE LIVIDENCE.
"Quick delivery, standard code quality in the form of commitment."
It's only been four hours. It's a fair price.
Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.
"The package is carefully packed, nice, quality, very pleased."
I'm very pleased with the product.
Very pleased about the product... thank you very much...
Use it well
"Good product, quick delivery, nice package, sure."
"Can this be used to sing livettrim? Oh, my God."
"The form ok, which has been listening to music for 2 hours but has not yet seen any warning about the battery. This device contains two distinct audio channels, if good source, the output is not very different. It's worth the price (the device can only connect to the same device at the same time)"
"Good delivery package, excellent quality."
"At the price of tens of thousands of people who haven't been 100K, nine Chinese companies are right, the sound is seven-tenths because sometimes you're going to hear music, and you're going to hear a little bit of it, and when it sounds good, it's not going to be as stable as it was when you put it on a live wire, it's going to be OK, hopefully for as long as you've been using it, because it's only three months."
"The device is about a half second and then half a second and then it's over and over again and again, and it's kind of annoying, and it's kind of pissed off, and it's almost 100K, and it's just pissed off, and it's calling the airline to know what it's like."
"The bad delivery, which doesn't work, even if it's possible to try and even look at the instructions on you tube, has been calling the operator since 8 o'clock in the morning until now, no one has ever taken responsibility or responded."
"Orders #4191416 charge transfers, then the red light will go off for about five seconds. I can't get a signal on, I can't get a signal."
"Look at the board that saw the MONO coming out there and say, ""Stree"". Turns out the DAC didn't use it, just over a zero o'clock."
"Now, there's a pretty uncomfortable problem with the lack of connection, which is that about two and a half hours later, the music is going to be lost, and the sound doesn't sound like the same thing over and over again, and it's going to be smooth."
"The product's OK, the first tryout's pretty cool, the package's packed, and nothing's wrong with it."
"Listen to the music and introduce that mic, you can't even talk, you can't talk, you can't talk, you can't talk, you can't talk about it, you can't talk about it, you can hear it, you can't talk about it."
"If you don't have the money to buy the perfect ear, you can't use the sound, you can't use the sound, you can't plug it in, it's more convenient."
"I've just received an immediate delivery, a broken and cracked organ, the way I use it, because I don't know how to use it."
- Packages ok (Short-Short-Short-Short-Short-Short-Short-Short-Short-Short-Sell)
"It's a signal that the quality of audio is so boring, it's generally called an end."
"The product's fine. The sound isn't as sound as if it's not connected through Bluetooth. When the connection jams other devices like wireless microphones, it's not much use, it's not all evaluated."
"The battery's weak, SD's an hour and the battery's dead."
"Four stars because... cheap, for the cost of 39k, you get a lot of plus costs, and it's hard to ask for quality, because if it's made in Vietnam, it's as difficult as China, it's probably higher than it looks: it's still good to spend a few weeks; it's not going to go down much, but there's two things: batteries are very low, and there's a lot of problems, and there's a lot of times when it's small."
"I bought two pieces of shop at Senedo very well, but when I bought another one on Tiki, which is also bluetoot music V 4.1, I was so disappointed that it sounded like mono."
"The phone link is OK, the sound is on, but no laptop, I don't know what else to install, but I'm mostly buying it for the laser, so it's kind of sad, for the three of us."
"In ideal use conditions, when noise signals such as Wi-Fi or 3G are too close and too strong to be noisy, the distance you use is about 450 meters, when there's a short wave, and the signal is slightly small, perhaps the use for earsets is more likely, and the cost of less than 100k is less than the amount of quality required."
"The quality's good, the sound's good, the capture's sensitive, but the battery's a little weak."
I bought two sound-changed devices with wireless wires.
"Point: Fast charge (about 30 minutes), the battery is fine (I hear more than 2 hours of battery failure)), fully attached accessorized accessories, linking the PCP in approximately 4 m, sound good. + CHRlCS: sound is delayed by approximately 0.5 seconds, so if you use a game you don't buy, you can avoid water and dust, which is a little bit expensive. + how long is it going to be? + how long is it going to be?"
"There's no lyrics, just music in the earphone or speaker."
The machine I was using was turned off and I got it every day.
"The product is exactly the same as described. The connection is quite fast, but the sound doesn't have a significant loss of quality, but it seems like a lot of errors. The first few times the notice is that English is available, but several times it's used, but several times it doesn't know how to change it. It's quite a short signal, and it's a short shot, and it's a bit annoying, and it's a bit annoying, and it's not a good choice."
"The sound-changed device has a wireless FSCV Music V4.1 captures a good signal, honest sound, easy to use. However, the battery of the sound-changer device has a wireless FSV4 Music V4.1 string, which has too much time to use, between 5 and 7 minutes is no longer available."
"I bought four, but one failed to charge the power, turned it on, asked for a store in exchange for another."
"Tiki's giving me the fakes, and it's frustrating to ask Tiki to reconsider, and I'm not happy with the product."
"You can't handle it, send it back immediately. Next week, you can get it back, you can check the package that you sent before you, you can't even use it again, like the original error, you can get it back, you can't hear it, you can't hear it, you can't see it again."

"The product doesn't support the microphone of the headphones, so it's not possible to talk when you're connecting the PCP, but you can only hear. The quality of sound in this range is reached."
"No answer, no answer, no answer, no return orders."
"The connection to the computer is too bad, the charge cable has to come in new, pulls out the charge line and the device is not working."
"I can use it, but it's a bad connection, so it's right next door with a short wave, and then it's all over the place."
There's only three stars left in the battery.
"The product can't be used, the charge goes up. The red button is about 5 seconds off."
"The sound quality is smaller than the next job plug into the computer, the phone."
"It's okay. I thought we were gonna have ears at first, but it's just a machine. It's a perfect price."
"A product like this... sound quality is good. But about the volume of sound when you hear it with loud headsets, and the sound is limited. It's only for jack 3.5 lines. Two lines are small."
"I've just bought a battery, and I've tried it, and I've lost my battery for an hour, even though it's described as four hours, and the songs that are high in music sound a little loud, make the experience very uncomfortable."
"Can't play sound with any equipment, earphones."
"According to M, music quality is only 70 percent better than live plugs."
"It's okay, whatever money you want, what money you're worth, I'd love to have a bin post on the phone."
The Mk got the product and couldn't connect the Bluetooth.
"The sound quality doesn't change much, the connection's good, every time the chimp or disconnect has a voice, only the battery is running fast."
"Listens to bass canss or prices, but the battery hybrids are too bad, it doesn't sound like a small four o'clock, but the battery points are too low."
"I bought three products, and I lost one product to the source, and Tiki changed another to me."
"Connection is OK, but when you play it, there's no sound coming out!"
The temporary product quality can be used
"The Bluetooth signal quality is too bad, but compared to the price that's too cheap, we give four stars."
"It's seasoned,pin's fast, it's loud, it's annoying, it's got VC weak, it's got a lot of improvement."
"I've been trying this once, it's been quiet, I'm sure I can't hear music, I'm about a meter away from the phone, I can't hear the connection, I can't hear it, I can't hear it."
"Pretty good at the price range, both in terms of sound quality and battery quality, not very far away, but, of course, harder to ask."
"A few times you can't afford it, but just tell me that a red light can't be full of batteries."
"The delivery's broken. It's not working. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no."
"The airline is not available, the connection is constantly polite, everyone is aware of the order."
I just got in this afternoon when my head fell in.
"The product is not connected. If you want it back, you can do it."
That's good.
can't connect to the machine......abcensor full of boxes is probably OK but spship comes to k like the image... it puts it in the bag -bk error transfers itself
"The goods, the goods, the goods, the good sounds, the batteries stop for over two hours, the gap from the short source (5 to 7 meters)."
I just bought two and a half months later and I can't use it anymore.
"Fine design, good handle, but the basic function of receiving/signing isn't quite as good as it sounds, it's not very loud."
It's a delivery store without a phone line.
"Toota, need time for sf"
"The product since it's been bought properly, except when it's charged, it's only for a while and then it's off, so I don't know if it's charged."
Missing Ok along with the guide sheet
Let me ask you why you can't connect the Bluetooth. I just got the package and I can't connect it.
The plug on the lamp cannot be started. The connection just received. Need to explain quickly. Do not lose the wrong money?
"If you can use it twice, shouldn't you buy it at this store?"
"The battery's pretty hard for six hours, but it's still 50 percent in the morning, quality's fine, but the mic's kind of lame, but it's not an external mic."
"Fast delivery, sp OK, good connection, quality time is known."
"Beautiful products, sounds very good, only the battery didn't sound long."
"It's not fully charged until 10:00 a.m., and it won't come up."
"The product's good, the music's good, the battery's two o'clock, at 65K's the price."
"Listen to my music. It doesn't sound good, even though the distance is close."
"Connections aren't very stable. Long since connection is lost. If no player is not played, the connection speaker is kept beeping."
"We're looking forward to receiving, we're losing the mood a little bit, we're connected to the phone very well, but the quality of sound is about 25 percent less than the direct ear plug."
I've bought three of them... like an unusable car... who has requested to return the package... disappointed in the way the delivery was delivered.
"It's not right, it's not right, it's not right, it's not right, it's not right, it's not right, it's not right, it's not right."
"Batteries are used, three times charged, cheaps are yours, don't buy them like you're wasting money."
"This product is too fast, now that you can't enter it, you can charge it for only three minutes, you can use it to plug it."
"It's only 30 to 45 minutes, not like a four-hour commercial, you guys on tiki should be working with the supplier again."
Too bad.
"Good, good, good, good, good, good, good."
"Oh, shit. I'm sorry, I've had enough of this shit, I've had a couple of break-ins. I've had a few times, and I've had no quality welding and welding."
"The product's ok at a price range, no problem in three months. Did you sleep at night listening to music without having a cell phone with you?"
"I've got two of them. Okay, I've got one, I've got one, I've got one, I've got one, I can't get it, I can't change the shop."
"I just got the package, I can't connect it."
"The battery's weak, it's about an hour away, and the Internet phone calls are all over it, and the connection's off, and it's off."
"But the goods are a little low, put on the new cars, and they're breaking up, and they're putting something else on them, because they're right for that price."
"A very bad product that only a few months has failed to charge and can no longer connect, it shouldn't be a waste of money."
The delivery is a long way off. The use is good. The price is a little bit smaller than when it's banned. The battery is relatively fine.
"Less use but fine number at price, no more request at this cost."
We've been tracking the bills since yesterday but we haven't received them today!
"Buying in can't connect bluetooh to any of them, offering me a store."
"I'm gonna take some time and then I'm gonna move from your voice to the sound of the train, and now I don't know how to correct it."
"A couple of times it won't be charged, and the batteries aren't charged, they can't be used."
"You bought two weeks, you're dead, you're back on the shop?"
"Very fast delivery, good product with very good sound quality, two hours of use."
"A week's worth of goods, but Tullius didn't come in, and Renard caught him at 6:30, and he lost his money."
"You can't buy it because you're too big, you can't plug it in, you're too weak, you're too short."
"Error product, not iOS and Android."
"The quality of sound is good, but the amount of battery is low, it's only three hours per hour."
"I wish time had been hard-timed, it would've been dry."
There's something handy when you connect.
"It's only been a week since we've been using it, and we've broken the jack Bambi, and it's so disappointing, we've just broken the earpiece."
Okay.
It works. Good sound isn't much different than a cell phone plug. The battery's a little weak.
Make it quick. It's a battery. It's a crab.
"You buy it and you charge it, you don't answer it with backup, so you don't preserve it."
"The switcher's pretty good. Okay, the battery hasn't been as long as it's expected, but it's all good at the price!"
Used less than two months of color flying.
"It's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good."
I can't use it anymore. I want my money back.
I want to cancel this order so I can buy another product and I don't know how to do my own supply store.
It's a little too small incoherent.
I can't hear the connection between the two ears in general.
"It's too cheap, it's just not that loud."
"Get a sensitive Bluetooth, the battery's four o'clock, low, low."
Too much if you use it for your car.
The quality of sound is too bad.
I'm satisfied with the price. It's pretty light. I'm using it properly. I've never seen any signs of abnormality.
"It's okay to use a conversation, but it's boring music. Consider it when you buy it."
"This product, when you receive no accompanying headsets, sounds are relatively good. You must specify more accompanying devices."
"Let me ask you if there's a warranty, and I'm buying all the batteries I can't find in the battery."
"It's no use, it's not convenient."
"It's fresh, but it feels okay, battery light is okay. tiki delivers as quickly as possible."
"Good connection, not too far away, good sound quality, worth buying."
Vfdh fghfssgu fhjdfvvggh
"The number of batteries is about an hour, and in general, there's no point in asking for more than that."
S sp bad connection. 30 centimeters. A little bit further. Lost connection.
"The order I ordered got it, but I missed the call. What am I supposed to do?"
"It's noise, it's flashy, it's encouraging you just to connect to your own cross-phone."
"It's cheap, but the quality is quite unexpected compared to the cost of money."
We've used it very well. It's either on the bass phone or it's not on the bass ear.
Tell me the delivery time of 18 and I haven't seen anything in 21 today... it's been a week.
"Batteries are bad, four o'clock vision works, but in fact it's only two hours since the battery's down."
"Good recording, stereo audio, solid product, fast delivery, carefully packed."
"I'm happy with sp. Quick delivery, nice envelope. Try to make it work."
"Tiki's quick delivery, nice product, good use, but the batteries are fast, so they're not really happy."
Okay.
"Listen to music for about an hour, wait two hours, the product doesn't work."
All right. What's your money? It's just a short connected distance.
How'd it go back in English? A few hours like conec to turn it off in Chinese.
"It's very small when you attach it to a speaker, so it's okay to use your phone ear."
"Use OK but the welding is weak, it's easy to break the wires when you crash."
Why did you turn it on? <i>I can't detect it.</i> <i>Someone's got it.</i> <i>I didn't show it to you.</i> <i>Who's got it.</i>
The delivery needs to be much faster to meet the demand for use.
You've got short backsets that fit this device for very little price.
It's a new feeling. Okay. It's about three or four hours of music. I don't know how to use it long.
The product failed to be used. The warranty waits too long.
You don't have to listen to ice cream. You've got to listen to ice cream.
"Buying a place full of ghosts through the wrong bed, a battery that's dead."
How come you haven't gotten it yet? The store hasn't been here in days.
"If we don't get the blt, then what should we do at the shop?"
"Jack's a little hard to plug. I mean, if it's a click, it's great."
"If you don't have a gift, you don't have a gift."
"The battery's 3-4, and the mono sounds are good, and the ship's cargo is labeled VNs."
"We're using, as we wish, as long as we don't know."
Quick delivery. The product looks like it's got an unknown amount of energy.
"Good quality, beautiful pattern, moderate volume."
Could not close temporary folder: %s
So you're charging the batteries? How do you charge the batteries? How do you charge the batteries?
"The delivery's okay, but the battery doesn't last an hour."
We tried it again by glued 502 but Jack couldn't.
The battery's a little weak. The connection's fine. How long can it be?
I bought 99K today and 75k...
"You see the commercial shop is Japanese technology, you see the Japanese ambassador, but you keep looking at the product, you don't see the words: ""Made in Japan,"" and you don't have any Japanese handwriting, and the product looks like it's Chinese, and the material doesn't look like it's Japanese, and you don't know how long it's going to last."
It's OK.
The package is very careful. <i>I don't know.</i> <i>I don't know.</i> <i>There's no time.</i> <i>There's no charge.</i> <i>Because there's no click.</i> <i>I don't know.</i> <i>I don't know.</i> <i>I don't know.</i>
"No singing, not even going to the power, not listening to sound."
"Right as described, perfected, good functions... quick delivery, packaged goods."
"Puts the black color with the red on it too beautifully, hahaha, it's pretty quality, but the plastic from the product is pretty bad."
Put two black decor you deliver in blue.
"Go back to the power, but don't sing..."
"Send fast, pack well, listen to USB music, SD cards, radio waves, loud sounds..."

The good product delivers fast
"The average reading rate, but stable."
Nice.
Sp ok
Strong Bass With Noise Resistment
An error on one side does not sound disappointed
"I know it's illegal, but it's not bad looking in the middle, but it's not bad."
It's been a long time since it's been a battery. I can't use it now.
"Buy two that short one charge and one earpiece, and that's not good."
Sp is good.
"It's the real product, it's like advertising, it's good stuff!"
The new product is good.
good quality product
"Good use, convenient type C."
"USB releases 128GB, reasonable prices, carefully packed shop, relatively fine copy speed. Your computer copys over 40GB takes more than an hour."
"The delivery was fast, especially in less than a day, although it was relatively small in size but it gave the feeling of moving and using it well, used to do the job demanding quite well, especially the feeling that it would be very smooth to play first-person shooters (FPS), the DPI button that adjusts mouse speed very well for various purposes such as for entertainment, as well as very good office service."
"Use very smooth, well-adjusted mouse pointers with their own application to adjust personalized functions."
Good goods: Photos are delicious.
Nice. Okay.
It's Digiworld's stamp. Two clicks long?
"Fast delivery, when you're first used, you're slow, but once you're in a while, it's normal."
"Fast delivery Shop, two days to destination. deliver the right product, the right quality bought twice, and there will be many more."
"The product is better than expected, the package store is carefully packed."
"Rats are very smooth, smooth, have four appropriate modes, and Ieds look very nice and professional."
"Besides the mouse being a little small for the right hand, moderate weight, light clicks, 8,000dpi for good sensitivity in all fields, well worth the cheap mouse piece that quality is good"
"I've been using it for almost five years, and the mouse's fine, and I don't have double clicks, like many people say, the product is generally good at the price range."
It's very good use. The macro's great.
Saigon has been working for three years.
"It's smooth, it's soft, it's nice, it's nice."
It's very good. The mouse's very gentle. I heard your friend's recommend said it was a good mouse.
"It's all right, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good!"
Good stuff.
"Colour customization, DPI. Feelings on mouse click are great."
The good product in the box hasn't been stolen. The friendly delivery man.
So good use very well hands extremely strong at the price
Pretty okay.
"sp's good. It's not going to work, it's slow delivery."

"The mouse is very good. With the dpi correction button very convenient, the season is a little bit limited. Buying this mouse about shooting csgo or pubg very well."
Ten big players playing okela
goods play smooth games
Okay.
"It's way too good for the price, it's very sure, it's the arm, it's got a lot of stuff like an Ied, it's level of oxygen, it's a key command."
Good delivery. Quick delivery.
"The current use is very good, but I don't know what the warranty looks like because the seal doesn't see a mouse paste or a box."
"The mouse fit hand, the good button, in terms of the long term unknown how the mouse like this is very good compared to the current price"
Rats are good. You should buy them.
"Very smooth, very smooth"
The delivery's been a while;-
"It's fine, smooth, no sign of guilt. Every purchase on the log community is cheaper than new."
SP is good

"The quality product's right for orders, quick delivery and careful packing."
"The delivery is faster than expected, the goods, the best forice within range."
"It's good, it's good, it's real product, it's only dk dpi and Ied."
"I've used a tg, I feel good, but I don't know if it's sustainable."
"It's possible that the package box that's been torn, torn, the box is torn. It's possible that it's due because it's prepaid that it should be cut, but if you're paid later, you'll never agree. Mouse that doesn't have a print stamp is different from a box shell. Please check the store and tiki again."
"Thank you, tiki's delivery on time."
It's a lot better than I thought it would be.
"The new box, the sense of being peeled is real."
"It's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good."
"Move, no. There's nothing left to look at."
"The package is carefully packed, the delivery is fast, the company's main goods are good."
The cave ok the shop. I'm going to be sore at the shop all the time.
"The good product, the whole set, is worth money."
"The delivery's pretty fast, very good."
"Rats are good at prices, hand-to-hand."
Just the right product.
"Well, it's worth it."
"Good product at a price range, pretty nice, sensitive."
Good mouse company.
Good quality.
It's a pleasure. Five stars.
Satisfaction
Good.
It's okay. Let's play a game without a warranty.
Good.
I've been on this sp for two months and it's worth a lot of money.
"The mouse uses it quite well. Light but the knuckles. The only thing with the wire is that it's a little hard and, in particular, not a device with LGS software."
"When you send it back, the box gets distorted, so it's a little scary at first, but it's okay to open it up. Sometimes when you're shooting csgo, you're gonna be jerked up or down. The logihub is still getting the mouse, the led rub is nice, but compared to deathadder elite, it's not as good as good as it is, but it's also easy to understand because it's like a quarter."
"Rats are good, we don't know how long it's gonna take to jump like a mouse before we buy it."
"A frog rat does a lot of work, but the log program doesn't accept it! Everyone should consider it so another 200 to find a place to buy the real mouse!"
"Hi Shop, this mouse that I bought for five months shows a click left mouse at two clicks at a time, and then in the seventh month, the mouse won't be able to click any more."
"You know, delivery likes to play T-times without playing three-time gays just to deliver a mouse, and then you end up running down to the bottom of the package to get it, but you'll never get it."
"The log blanket does not receive a mouse. If you don't answer, it's pretty much against the client."
You can use it. It's a little light.
"It seems like it's been a long time since the shock error, but I've got to pull it back so I can use the little hand to use it pretty well, but the big guy needs the big mouse, he should buy the other one."
I thought this was g102 prodigy. I got a lightsync.
"The good stuff is at a price range, but one thing I'm a little concerned about is the series on the other side of the mouse:(("
"Beautiful form, quality must wait time"
"Mouse uses pretty well, when you plug it directly into the machine, it's fine to plug it through the transition point."
Fast delivery; quite satisfied with the product! but why demand an observation over 50 characters??
"It's okay, everybody. It's okay."
Shop k supports customers
"The mouse's good, but it's only a few months away from getting double-clicked."
"Rats are pretty good, new, got tiki support now, but there's not a gift package that only prints a few words into the bill that looks like shit."
"Hold the mouse quite oce, stroke the ball up quite upset using the povray file"
"Saigon has five days of double-clicking, now I don't know if it's warranty. It's too boring."
"It's genuine. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, but the box's a little twisted. Okay. Except for one star."
"The product is quite smooth, playing the game, which is relatively fine."
"Good product, quick delivery, satisfaction."
Could not close temporary folder: %s
"The price's right, the quality's okay."
"All right, quick delivery, thanks tiki."
It's now after a month of use that there's double clicks...
The package's fine.
"Packed carefully, low-cost goods exactly as sold."
Okay.
"Good straps, good delivery on schedule."
& Remove
Okay.
"The straps are fine, but they're a little itchy."
"Unlike advertising, colors suck."
"Rows are as light, as light as cloth."
"A little loose, a little small for a clock size."
Why don't you go get yourself a shop?
I'm not sure. I'm OK with it.
Colors are a bit dark for pictures
"The solid charge, the thick, the two-headed plastic cable, the gray one, it looks beautiful, the good one, the good one, the right one, the right one, the right one, the right one, the right one, the right one, the right one, the right one."
The cable with the wire on the outside looks definitely connected to the quick charge. Quick delivery.
"The good product, well, has 14 numbers on the side, and check out check on the radar.com, and it's exactly the same thing, and there's nothing about putting the speed delivered in two hours that's always very pleased."
It's just two times I've been able to get it right. I'd like to have a really tight-knit kit.
"Wire quality's fine, it's short as expected, but it's all good."
"Quick delivery, carefully packed..."
Good quality cable.
"It's solid, it's strong, it's beautiful, it's quality."
It's a good product.
It's good enough to deserve five stars.
H
"It's on the side, it's on the side, it's on the side, it's on the side, it's on the side, it's on the side, it's on the side, it's on the side, it's okay."
"Good use, quick charge."
It's fine. It's very hard.
Good Use
Okay!
Good.
"Okay, that's a lot of fun."
"Sure, nice."
It's okay.
"Use it very well, very quickly."
"Nice, sure."
The cable's good.
Good.
"Sure, it's like advertising."
"() Uncounting Tiki's score for non-resolved delivery, I'm returning the stuff to Tiki's refusal to accept, and it's wrong for Tiki to keep the money and not return it."
"Sound's good, no earaches, good fight."
Like
"It's so beautiful. It's so good. It's got rubber on it, so it won't take long to get an earache. It's too good."
"It's very small, it's very convenient to have a rubber with no pain. It's a very convenient touch. It's okay. It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay."
The package is waiting for time. It's really cool. It's tight. It's tight.
"You know, the first time you bought a cheap headset, and that's it. There's a soft ear button. It's so good."
See the ad ok buy it for use. Feels like a prestigious business commercial for a 5-star shop.
The hearing can't play. I want to change.
The product is better than you can imagine. It sounds really good. It's all settled.
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry, but I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry, but I'm so sorry."
"All right, well, let's hope it lasts."
"It's good to hear, it's long gone, it's good for the battery, it's good for the ear, it's also for the store, it's a cable."
This product can't connect Bluetooth.
It's pretty cool when you get it. It's good. It's good. It's good. It's good. It's good. It's good.
Could not close temporary folder: %s
"It's a very prestigious store, everyone's earpieces, and it's the same as the one with the good ear. It's worth the money."
"The product is quite agreeable. Even though the delivery of the box is a bit gnarly, it's a little cheap, but that's a good quality that doesn't expect much."
"Nice headsets, easy to use, stable connections, soft, soft ears cushions."
"The earpiece is so beautiful, it's so black, it's so black, it's really good. It's really good."
I really liked this product.
Okay.
"His headset's good, he hasn't tried to separate two separate uses yet. Let's see if we can separate them."
"Good hearing ears, good sound at the price, beautiful pattern, fresh product, very fast delivery, putting tiki now 2 hours have been received, very pleased."
"I swear to God, the first time you buy something that feels good, the two earphones sound good."
The earpiece is clear. It's warm. It's soft. It's strong.
"The earpiece is stable. It's very comfortable, but it's also a credit card bag."
"The goods are on schedule, the prices are good for the goods, the money is worth the money when it comes to buying the product, supporting the long shop."
Cinnamon's earbuds are good.
Sounds ok the strange-looking product did add a reasonable charge cable
"It's loud. It's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good."
"I mean, you're new, you're full of cheap ears, and you're good with sound."
"That's right. Good. Good. Good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good."
Five stars for this product. Good stuff. There's nothing to talk about.
"Listen to good talk. Listen loud, easy to use. Not as loud as the ears before you buy."
"It's okay. It's beautiful, but it's not sustainable."
"Two earpieces can't hear at the same time. Oh, my God, what's with one ear or the other?"
"The earpiece is very smooth, the sound is excellent, the sound is very smooth."
It's okay with the headset. It's long enough for the earache.
The strap is the rubber should be softer than the plastic.
"By listening to your judgment, your hearing ears are good at the price."
"earphones are good, rubber pads are smooth."
"His ears are full of satisfaction, and his ears are good."
(Laughter) (Applause) (Applause) (Applause) (Applause)
Good delivery 5*
"It's easy to do smooth mouse, and it's very nice to use, and it's very broad skin mats, so it's so that you can get both your mouse and so on."
"It's very nice and it's very nice and it says to buy these things at home and at the agency, and it's very nice to have a colleague commending them, and it's good to buy them, and it's good to meet them after we've consulted some of them."
"The package is packed carefully, and the product is as beautiful as the ad should be bought."
Hurry up and I'll buy two to use and give it to my friend here. Tiki's working very professionally.
"All right, slices. Okay. It's nice. It's easy to get dirty."
It's nice. It's a shop. It's a mouse.
It's beautiful.
"The price is reasonable, the model is nice, the delivery is fast, but it looks like the sp image is only 4 edges, but the sample is just slippery, so it's going to take some time."
"It's a nice decoration, but it's okay to go with the regular mouse pad."
I put gray moss and I call it black.
Good.
Standby.
"Smells a lot, a little uncomfortable."
The color doesn't match the picture on tiki
"It's very handy, sure, it's easy to use, it's good price."
Not Like the Advertising Picture
"The product scratches like it used to, the toes are loose, the telephone neck is weak."
"The legs are loose, the legs are not hard, the colors aren't exactly the same."
Good.
Synchronising folder
I don't know.
Good.
It's good. It's good. It's good.
"Good battery, guys."
The product meets the demand.
"The package carefully, new, newly used feels pleased"
"I've just received the machine but press off the screen, the key light is still on, but the dark screen expects the store to communicate."
"Newly purchased, quality-like, wrapped-up, test batteries, thanks shop."
"The screen isn't very nice, but it shouldn't be too demanding at this price."
"Well, the battery's been in use for a long time, but the whole middle-class doesn't understand anything, the HD book is in English, it's in all Chinese?"
"I couldn't find the home button, so I couldn't install it."
"Use it well, the quality of tiki's services is good. Thank you, shop."
It's like it's not glued.
That's a beautiful product.
It's very nice.
"Picking a 44mm size, why did you deliver 40mm?"
It's beautiful. It's more than expected. It's a quick delivery.
"It's Nillkin, quality, sustainable design, anti-slip design."
"It's beautiful, it's quality."
It's good. Too bad you're gone.
"Good quality product, fair price, quick delivery."
Okay.
That's great.
Fine quality.
"It's nice, but it doesn't stick up the screen because it's going to burst in the corner because it's too tight."
I don't know if it's going to work for a long time.
"Nice style, tight hug, quick delivery."
Tot

"You're cute, you're cute, you're cute, you're cute, you're cute, you're cute, you're cute, you're cute, you're cute, you're cute, you're cute, you're cute."
It's beautiful.
Good.
"Okay, quality as described."
Good product.
"Two months is good, no yellow."
It's beautiful.
"It's pretty cool, got a safety mark, so it's more reassuring."
"Light as cats' fur, white and white, scrotum design, hand-holding RGs, super-war lights, before buying too much logi 300k sensors, different brands, now building new pcs up this one for sure."
I haven't spent the last two months. It's gone.
"Nice, smooth, quick delivery."
"No receiver is to sell window versions and not receiver into boxes instead of selling version to Mac, the title of the product is deceptive."
Very good quality. I'm sorry there's no black.
"It's the purpose of buying, and it's beautiful, but it's the use of heat, and it's the satisfaction of it."
"The product looks good, well within the price range, each without adding the phone clip, buying about just looking."
"It's a little light, I'm not sure."
"It's not exactly a commercial, no wires, and a phone clamp. One star. That's it."
Very good.
"It's not the image, it's not the phone."
A sure use of the cylinder
"There's no point in dealing with the hard stuff up top, and it's not good business."
"The quality, the good, the well-sponsored item, the package, it's all right, it's all good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good."
"The machine is good, it's not bad, it's long-term use, it's friendly delivery."
Uh-huh.
"Oh, my God. I bought it, and the product's watered on my screen, and I switched it back."
"It's like advertising, buffalo batteries."
"- Copying files that are *.avi that are not available, with the sample file in the same machine *.avi still broadcasts normal, so we don't know how to listen to our favorite files that are available *avi, if we have to switch them, it's too much time."
"The small machine form is small, sure with two powerful glasses and a blue aluminum pane. The screen is only 128px for very bad quality, but with such a player it's not necessary to have high resolution screens that will cause battery loss."
"Small, neat, metal frame should hold cool. The level of completeness is good. If you buy for images or videos, you should not, because of low resolution. The quality of sound is good."
"Why did you plug in a computer that just received a charge that couldn't be copied? If you tried using another player to connect it, you'd still get it as usual."
"The engine is beautiful, but since there is no speaker on the outside, it is an inconvenience!"
"Package received, however Cid does not work, but the machine is not as beautiful as the image."
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry."
"Very handy, very foul-smelling."
That's great. I guess I'm the one who bought this charge.
"The products are sure, the angles are handled carefully, they're nice, they're beautiful, the face-to-faces with laptops have a nice piece of rubber, they're not scared of the laptop, they're generally very happy."
"The best product I've ever used for computer planning, because the structure is so open, is able to get all the necessary angles (high, bowed down)."
There's also a non-scramble rubber button on the shelf.
"The product sure, the delivery is on schedule, I'm fine, thank you very much for the store."
"It's OK, friendly delivery, thanks to Shop so much, the best Buddha's treat, the greatest miracle in the world, the magic of kung fu, the honor of honoring our health, the Buddha's Buddha's birthday, to improve our health."
"Fast delivery, well packed, product when unboxed, high-quality hard product, saves a lot of space for my desk and job."
The product is extremely good. The price is reasonable. The shelf can change two directions: height and tilt.
"It's really tough, guys, but I can put five kilograms of book on it, and it's not worth the money, so it's good to use books or computers to study it."
"Hard-core, sure, the company itself, fast delivery, but if you raise the surface area a little bit, it's much better."
The product is exactly what it looks like. It's packed very carefully.
"Tiki delivers fast, package well."
"Advantage: Very sure, beautiful, very free-adjusted range: Need to use the support tool (mounted) whenever change is high"
The package shop is relatively careful.
"It's pretty early, it's been three days, it's pretty good, it's pretty good, it's easy, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good."
"The package should be avoided carefully, distorted... putting down on the table unblinked (bought elsewhere because it's just a package wrap, delivered quickly, and working with a computer to help with the neck pain with the help of this computer.) Thank you, Shop."
"Pack your bags carefully, steady lift -- however, if possible, improve your spirals for more convenience -- for example, the cochles that have ears to adjust by hand -- the kind that have ears or installs on the drums. (Music)"
"It's a solid metal rack, I put the computer on it very reassuringly, and it's been a long time since I've evaluated it so that I can feel the product carefully and I'm happy with what this laptop has to offer, and I love this product."
"Hard cable, right, kkkk color. thinks it's easy to turn the phone upside down without having a mham."
"The product is much bigger than thought. The lap 17 is still standing, the hard leg is open, so it doesn't fall, and there's a pin attached to it that can change the joints."
"The package is carefully packed, the delivery is fast, and the quality is not yet evaluated."
"Quick delivery, heavy packing, quality ok"
"The tweezer looks kind of remote, but it probably does, and it doesn't know how to get it up to the shop to know how to get it to the shop, and it's a little bit more powerful: etc. And it's nice and it's simple. If you buy it, you should buy it because it's neat down there, it's better to get it, it's good and there's no problem at the moment."
"I like the price that can go up and down and down, as well as sure, and this one's good for you, and it's worth a lot of money."
I'm happy and I'm going to support the shop.
"Actually sp qa review on the Internet, I forget."
"Nice color, long-term Ship from the plague, but OK, there's something else to squeeze the snail."
"I'm pretty sure, I use my 15-inch grams of heavy laptop, which is fine, adjusts the previous angle, and then puts the machine up because it's so hard, and it comes with a screw-up tool to adjust the spirals."
"It's solid, it's perfect quality, it's packed up, it's delivered earlier than the date, it's better with the laptop, it's better with the neck, it's better with the product, I'm happy with the product."
"The package is carefully covered, preservated, and supported for loosening the screws/ tights. The leg is strong, able to withstand the laptop. If you don't have a keyboard, you can type in your laptop, and your neck hurts, so buy it."
"I don't know, I don't know, I'm pretty heavy, and I'm fine with the screws, and I'm happy."
"It's solid, it's perfect, it's good, it's good to use, it's good to buy."
"I got the product, I got the laptop, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it."
"For the first time, buy a laptop after a long time, list a laptop on a book, top-of-the-line, solid frame, fancy color, five stars for the shop."
It's amazing how you use it with your wife.
"The product is sure, the design is neat, it's not going to take area, it's going to raise, it's going to lower as the user needs it."
"The material is very good, and it's up to you to adjust the altitude so that it's appropriate; the price's solid, you can put your hand up and type on your keyboard, but when you type, you're still shaking a lot, and you can weigh this point."
"I think it's a little expensive to put 500K on a shelf, but it's a lot of quality and a lot of value, and it's worth a lot of money, and it's a lot of neck pain."
"Take the package three days after putting it, package it carefully, right kind of, tough, unmovable joints, use it fine."
"Get the real quality opener, good credit, which is worth the price, by the way, to celebrate your new kaka toy."
"It's good stuff, it's good stuff, it's good stuff, it's good stuff, it's good stuff, it's good stuff, it's good stuff, it's good stuff, it's good stuff, it's good stuff, it's good stuff, it's good stuff, it's good stuff, it's good stuff, it's good stuff, it's good stuff, it's good stuff, it's good stuff."
"I like to make sure I'm strong, and I feel better when I'm working than if I've got some really neat-looking Standman."
Fine quality
"Sure, light, easy to move, new product to fit the pattern."
"If there's any more magnets or a slightly larger side of the machine, then it's a lot better for the laptops with big trunks."
"The quality is still going to shake when you type, you use the loose key, so this doesn't affect the experience, I don't think there's any that doesn't ring."
"I'm using my laptop, which is pretty heavy."
"Fast delivery, so that the laptop looks at the table very comfortably, but it should be used with a loose keyboard, typing directly on the laptop still has a vibration."
It's not consistent with lap 15:6 because it's heavy.
"The beautiful design product, sure, the aluminum material, the silver mass, should look very luxurious, have a thin pad, so it's less likely to scratch the laptop, buy the delivery, it's a little late, but it's understood, for five stars."
"The color is so beautiful, it's so big, it's so neat, it's so tight, it's so beautiful, it's so tight, it's so beautiful, it's so nice, it's so nice, it's so beautiful, it's so beautiful, it's so beautiful, it's so beautiful, it's so big, it's so nice, it's so nice, it's so beautiful, it's so nice, it's so big, it's so tight, it's got a thick blanket."
"Prices are like descriptions, very strong and sure."
Raised a fairly high slow neck laptop. There is a space that can be left to the keyboard (should be purchased).
I'm pretty sure.
"The product is solid, the metal frame is hard-core, adjusting the angle according to plan, it's worth a lot of money."
It's quite expensive.
"Viewing the table as sure, how come when you type it shakes like an earthquake?"
"The product is very good, it's hard-core. There are screws attached to fit if it's then loose. The delivery shop is fast, packed carefully."
Thanks to the shop.
"Sure, the levels are high, now we're only concerned if four snails are rusty or not."
"The product is so beautiful, and it goes over, and it's really heavy, and the details are very thorough, and there's a slide under it, so it's very fixed, and there's a thin pad on the table, so let's put the laptop up and it's fixed and it's not scratched."
"The product is solid, elaborate, careful."
"It's good, it's a bit of an adjustment to get it right, and then it's a little tight."
"Table speed delivery, solid solid product, logo tomayoko himself."
"Beautiful and sure, tiki delivers fast"
"I'm using it to support Mac 2/20 computers, and although the machine is heavy, the leg is still stable, and it's going to buy another one for home and one for the office."
"The product is solid, to get both laptops and tablet computers."
"It's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good."
The product's exactly what it's like. The baby's using both laptops and ipads. The product should be bought for the kids in the school season online.
"Sure, quality, mixed bag."
"The gods are sure, perfect."
"The price is solid, it's good, everyone's in condition to buy it, it's long-term, it's good to use it."
"The best thing is to keep it warm, while there's a place for the keyboard to leave very well."
"They're fresh, they should be bought."
"Quick delivery - carefully packed with warranty - accompanied by a hard-wired, fully present - I haven't done the screws yet, but it's pretty tight when unboxing and adjusting - let the machine look good, content - use longer to know how Hilt shop is"
"Nice, 9.5 points, nma I didn't notice mistaking his father for gray while preferring silver to haza."
"Photos, nice cans, fast delivery tiki."
"Use it with great pleasure, save your neck, or grow weary back, and you should buy it if you use it to work at your desk, if you want to learn a lot!"
"The whole aluminum structure, it's so solid, something's a bit of a mess, it's got to go to the store in case it's a good idea."
Put it in one place because it's too big.
"Good product, sure, quick delivery, quality efficiency."
"Steady, steady, strong!"
"The price was pretty sure, although it was a little big to bring along."
It's beautiful. It's definitely beautiful.
"Give your child an online education, help him with the hunchers, need an external mouse set."
"Stable, well-deserved at cost, forward, and bright."
It's a beautiful product. It's probably like a product introduction. There's a little bit of a screw-up. The price's a little rough.
"Hard product, sure, quick delivery."
Thank you very much for your good manners.
"- A high-end product that suits you, my pro Macbook, has a soft silicon cushion that doesn't break the computer."
It's really fine with me.
"Pretty, pretty sure, should buy"
"The beautiful, sure, appropriate price to be fixed at the desk saves space."
"The solid structure, the material for the higher sensation, the two separate tilts for the higher diversity, the overall good product. Five stars!"
"Hard, nice. You can put your laptop 15,6in on normal. You should buy your silver or gray."
"We've seen a lot of ads about this product, and as much as we can expect, it's very convenient for laptops and keyboards to leave."
I'm so pleased. I'm sure it's super fast.
"I bought this second one for using it to teach online not to bend, and it's better for my neck."
Okay.
"Nice design, sure, can customize altitude, can be used more quickly."
"It's worth the money, the extra luxury price, with a very convenient screw-up to adjust the dedicated store to further support."
"The machine's very good, but it's still very good, it's easy to adjust, but it's not loose."
"Hard cable, sure, don't move when you type."
"The new stuff, the joints are a little stiff, but it's a screw-up, so it's convenient to manipulate."
"The package price was carefully packed, opening up very thick, sure, very tasteful."
"The price is solid, adjustable to demand, deliver fast, pack carefully."
"The cost of people working hard with laptops, not worrying about neck pain, heavy aluminum, large health, so that their laptops can be very secure."
"The price is solid, the delivery isn't delivered quickly from Hanoi."
"That's a really good quality -- hard cable, a lot of the right angle -- there's a silicon pad, so don't worry about the product satisfaction machine -- so let's get the 3 kilogram computer up there that's still as sure as the wound."
"Solid product, quality."
"It's funny, it's solid, it's solid."
It's fine compared to the price of the city.
"The product looks very sure, but the toolbar to open the evidence shop screws is rusted."
"Tiki delivers fast, the product looks pretty sure and nice, good use"
"The product's good, but I haven't yet received a bill, hoping to send me a bill as soon as possible, thank you."

"Sp must have bought last night, there was today, super fastship."
OK.
It's nice and it's definitely good.
"Sure, with the keyboard outside it's a card."
"Sp is exactly what it looks like, the box looks pretty good, but even though it looks a little thiner than expected."
"Good use (not used long enough to know how strong), but I hope it's too long to deliver. The date will be delivered until seven days later. @info"
"Good, but the 154 inch laptop is a little weak."
"It's okay, it's not a good time to buy it. Now it's easier to find ARM."
I'm sure of it.
"It's okay, it's hard, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good."

Okay.
"The price is solid, but it's light and it's light, it's about one millimeter thick, it's not the same quality as the price, it's the right satisfaction."
"The aid rate on keyboards, which is quite high compared to the design that doesn't calculate the scale of the screen when you're typing, only fits the outside keyboard, makes the low-performance adjustments because of the mine, the mine is rusted, the package is open, so you don't order the translation shop, so you don't give it back, for two stars."
"The design price is shaken when you type a keyboard on your laptop. This should be used only if you have an external keyboard. If you want to type a laptop key, you should use a solid blocker."
"The aluminum support of beautiful, delicate design, but when you type it, the screen will still have a slight shake. If a person does less type-related work, which is just surfing the web or reading the news, it's very convenient and appropriate to use this product."
"Sure, we still need to turn the screws around, so it's not very convenient, it's not cheap for a product like that."
"I'm pretty sure. <i>It's a bit of a big deal to use at home.</i> <i>But notice, if you type in a laptop on this Earth, it's going to shake a little bit.</i> <i>I'm using Macbook Pro 15.</i> <i>And if you use a loose keyboard, okay.</i> <i>It's okay.</i> <i>It's okay.</i> <i>It's okay.</i> <i>It's okay.</i> <i>It's okay.</i> <i>It's okay.</i> <i>It's okay.</i> <i>It's okay.</i> <i>It's okay.</i> <i>It's okay.</i> <i>It's okay.</i> <i>It's okay.</i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i> <i>"
"That's OK. It's OK. I'm warning you, but for the buyers, if lacttop types directly on the shelf, then there's still a sound on the screen when you type."
"The snails are loose, they're squeezed when they're used."
"Four stars because the quality of the good product, the whole aluminum, was very pleased, could have been five stars if the joints of stand could have been synced (so that it wouldn't happen that it wouldn't change the laptop and it wouldn't have been difficult to edit)."
"Certainly, it's easy to use, but it's relatively small in size than a 15 and a half-inch laptop."
"The product is OK but the delivery is slow. Sets daily 21st, expected to arrive on 23 but 28 new ones are received (no reason) by TikiNkow smartlogistics and J&T."
"The price's fine, but the store is handing over the rusted screws. I'd rather not deliver them than look down on the customers."
"Certainly, the delivery is a little late than expected, but because of the epidemic, it's acceptable."
"The product's good, but the price's a little high."
"Pretty sure, there's a slightly tired spiral. This one's gonna be hard to get because it's gonna have to turn the screws away. So it's only gonna make sense to be in one place."
"It's pretty sure, and it's flexible and there's keyboards and there's no keyboards."
"The good store store and advice are very passionate, the hidden and very beautiful, the two stars because I'm too tired to deliver."
"It's good at the price, whatever it is, it's good."
The nice stuff's definitely a little bit twisted.
"The only problem is that the screws are a little rusty, and the rest of the price is OK."
"It's an inconvenience, it's a screw-up, so it's more convenient to use different patterns."
"Error, frame is very weak."
"Computer support looks solid, but it's taking time."
"It's been less than a month since the rubber bursts, and besides this, I can see that it's okay."
It's definitely a small product with a 16.4-inch laptop.
It's okay. I hope it's okay.
"The product's not going to equal it, but it's going to be okay."
"It looks like a convenient sure thing, and it'll be evaluated when you try it."
"Sure, and use it pretty good. Okay. Nice package."
"I don't know, but when you put your laptop up, it's kind of tilting to the left."
"Basically good, but it's hard to lift it up and down."
It's a little shakey.
It's a nice place to pack. I don't know what you're talking about. I don't know what you're talking about.
The relative product is okay.
"Quality okay, but it's a little high."
"It's a little less flexible than the price, so we can use it to stabilize. Okay."
"Good product, as expected."
Sp is just as good as the description.
"It's good, but it's good. It's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good."
"OK, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay."
Good but a little bit awkward and too soft.
"Well, that's easy to scratch."
TERRIA
"Hop me tien, coral ohu hop family"
"Okay, good stuff."
"We're good, we're good, we're good, we're good, we're good, we're good, we're good, we're good, we're good, we're good, we're good, we're good, we're good, we're good, we're good, we're good, we're good, we're good, we're good, we're good, we're good, we're good, we're good, we're good, we're good, we're good."
C_lose
Hard cable okay!
It's good. It's good. It's good.
To be vilified.
"Shipper delivers by hand rescheduling the delivery day, no contact with the guests, very uncomfortable."
"It's neat, it's good, it's good, it's plugging for quite a long time, it's not hot, it's good to use it."
"It's all about the heart, and it's not like it's beautiful."
"It's solid, beautiful."
It's plastic shells like a commercial.
"Good product, carefully packed."
The store is packed carefully.
"I told you, it's the same company."
"Nice quality, just two pieces of strength and one towel."
"Very pleased, about 350MB/s when using this cable plug for ssd box"
"The cable is a little faster to trace or record, than USB 3.0."
Fine quality
Saigon is OK. Okay.
Thanks Shop and Tiki.

"The product's right, it's very exciting!"
"Big bag, sure enough to get onepin charge."
"Quality row, fine fabric"
Fine.
Four-and-a-half points. The product is better than the price.
"It's not as if the space inside the bag is narrow, and the places in it are so small that it's almost impossible to get anything out of it, I let my city carry stuff, I don't use it as a walking package."
"The wire is fine, but it doesn't make sense to design the inside space, and there's only one place where the battery can be saved, and the rest is the charge, and the charge doesn't have room to leave the battery in."
Just bought the product that opened it up!
It's a small product that doesn't hold as much stuff as I thought it would be.
It's a special delivery. Can the shop change it?
It's good. It's got a lot of backup cable.
The bag's a bit dirty.
"The compartments are too small, and the accessories are not good inside: easily dropped when the bag opens."
sp is thinner than expected.
The delivery is faster than expected.
"It's thin, it's loose, it's locked, it's not sustainable, it's too high, it's too high."
"See bth, pretty small bag..."
The product's fine. It's worth the price. Everyone's fine.
Deliver the right color demand -- nice product like an ad.
"Too bad, the goods are so bad, it doesn't look like they're in the picture."
That's good compared to the price.
I can't help it.
The good package is very nice.
Use it fine.
"The quality is good compared to the price of money, and it takes time to know that it doesn't last for five stars."
The price is solid. Tiki delivers fast!!!!
"Okay, that's definitely true of the description."
"Very pleased with this delivery of tiki. The 100k freeship charge at 17 hours picked up the fast delivery at 2 o'clock, then went to bed at 19 o'clock on the same day that Mr. shipper called up to pick it up."
Fast delivery good use.
"Small, quick, good-lined, quick delivery, packaged, good service attitude."
"Okay, good stuff bought twice."

"It's good, it's fast, it's loaded, it's quick, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's full of batteries, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good."
It's been a while since I've been able to charge as fast as I can.
"Fast, sustainable charge, long time no problem."
"Quick delivery, quality goods, but packing needs to be spongy in order to prevent collisions."
Tiki delivers fast and well packed.
"It's very good, it's a nice package!"
"Good use, good delivery. Right charge."
"Fast, steady, good price."
Charge is fine.
"It's good. It's good. It's good.

The phone charge has a quick signal that thinks the actual image buys sp is not like the store's sp.
"It's normal to charge slow, long-term charge."
"Get a quick charge, but not a quick charge."

"Perfect leather, beautiful design."
Nice.
"Nice goods, sustainable materials, but there's no camera shield as described."
"Just in time, the fine figure found in the introduction was donated to the screen patch but could not be seen."
It's a bit expensive compared to the price.
"It's good, it's a little heavy."
It's a hell of a rush. <i>One hundred thousand megawatts.</i> <i>I'll buy it with CAT7 cable.</i> <i>I'll buy it on Tiki.</i> <i>I'll buy it for you.</i> <i>It's worth it.</i> <i>It's worth it.</i> <i>It's worth it.</i> <i>It's not worth it.</i> <i>It's worth it.</i> <i>It's worth it.</i>
It's exactly like a quality ad. Okay.

"It's only been a minute since the warrants went off, and the high price is bad, so people shouldn't buy it."
Resolute Connections
The airline fits the product.
That's great!
Translucency of the back.
The delivery is boring.
"It's not 20,000 as much as I think it's gonna be about 5/50."
"It's a little sticky when you wipe your laptop screen and your phone, and it's not like other cleaners. So remove it without pictures."

"The microphone is good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good."
"Great sun, the bad voice that you hear through this mic is so good, it's so good for people who love to sing that the shopping conditions are so limited, it's sad or it's fun to make some copies of it okay not to bother their neighbors."
I'll take care of it. I'll see if it's better on the outside. It sounds good. It doesn't matter.
"It's not hard to wait, it's solid, it's connected fast, it's got a very specific manual."

"I'm sorry, sir. I'm sorry, sir. I'm sorry. I'm sorry."
"You can't turn it on after the charge, at least before you send the storeers a check."
We're tired of singing because we don't support sound effects!
I'll take care of it.

It's standard. Okay.
The quality fits the price.
It's hard to read. It's perfect.
"The product has to be beautiful from the code to the quality, the loud sound speaker is unscramble, the right pass is, there's probably no other soundbar model that's better and better than this one for the entertainment angle."

"Sets the black white, the unknown quality of the product, so give the next three stars, and expect the next store to be delivered to the client in the right color."

Okay.
"Sure, but since it's so hard to adjust, you have to use strong force, women use it inappropriately."
"Is the Shop selling a personal clip for the phone, rather than an ad for a phone clip and an ipad, but when theship only has an ipad, how do you use it?"
The iphone cap is very bad.
"It's OK, it's kind of vibrational when you touch it, even though you only use your iPhone se."
"The price's too hard, the shape's hard to change, the phone's wallet."
Quality product.
"K just ipad pro, weak"
"You know, I put a pin in my hand that I can have an ipad. I don't have a place to pick out the type, I don't want to buy it, I can't accept it."
The clamps seem to break easily
"Stubborn braces, a little hard to break, convenient clamps."
I shouldn't have bought it.
The spring phone clamps are too jammed.

"This mouse is smooth, the mouse speed is adjustable, everything is OK, but the size is too big, this one doesn't fit for people who paint my office, because using a lot of it is going to get tired of hands."
It's convenient to rotate so quickly when you don't use it.
"The product is like describing, picking up good waves, loud sounds, so buy."
"It's beautiful as a description, it's very good to catch waves, it's uncomplicated, it's good to hear mp3 music, it's a light flashlight, and it's an untested Bluetooth connection, but it's fine."
"The normal function, except one function that we need most is that the DC 5V plugs don't work, the Shop doesn't know the AC/DD source of this product."
We can only catch each vov1 on the left side of an amalgam.
"We've got a good signal. Sound is clear. Okay, but what kind of battery is it?"
Badness doesn't look like advertising.
"The power is irregular, the connection is bad, the device is vulnerable."

I just can't hear it.
You can't use your headset.
"Unfortunately, it's not going to work exactly as a function."

Nice form of use accompanied by a buy-and-taker charge.
I'm fine.

Is it the right product to deliver fast?
Nice backs hold the phone close but press the source button and increase the volume
The product looks good. Be careful with the good stuff.
It's not okay.
It's too small.
It's fine. The main wire won't fit directly into the ipad m1. Use the conversion port is fine. I don't know why.
"Oh, yeah, it's good to go. It's good to go, it's good to go, it's good to go, it's good to go, it's good to go, it's good to go, it's good to go, it's good to go."

"Nice aesthetics, but not sure. The feature for supporting thepad is not as good as it can be used as possible, it's not sure, it's going up and down all the time."
"The skin doesn't go well with the use, it doesn't always stick together, it just wants to fall off, and the magnet isn't looking good."
"But the lid is a little bit wide compared to the machine ipadform 2), about 2 millimeters."

Okay.
"Nice, quality."

That's great!
"It's the right color, the outside side of the cover is the plastic, the embezzling face, the plastic back, the soft rubber frame, the tightness, the tightness and certainty, the magnet that turns off the curtain when you close the cover."
"Ipad, I'm a Starlight 9.7-7, so there's a few extra holes, but the hugs are tight and firm, and it's smart to turn off."
"The skin sack is designed to be delicately designed to the small detail, and the taki is generally very pleased with Tiki's product and service quality."
"- Nice delivery, good advertism, a speaker's place for details, not like some other case where the speaker just puts out a long gap."
The product's pretty solid and beautiful.
What a beautiful skin! <i>When you installed it on IPad Air 2</i> <i>Taki delivers it quickly!</i> <i>It's today!</i> <i>This is great!</i>
"These skins have two kinds of rubber, plastic, and this is what I buy, this is pure rubber, this 0 worry crack, this plastic that looks close to it, but it's going to see that the apple logo is dim from the back, and it's completely hidden from the back, and people should buy this because it's more sustainable, but it's going to cost zero more money."
"The carefully packed, nice, thick Case fits the ipad Air, slightly wide (uncut) when used for ipad Air-2"
"It's a beautiful leather bag, good quality, fresh product, right along with my Ipad Air Two."

Beautiful product and fit ipad Air-2
"The general product for the ipad line is 9.7 inches, so a lot of extra detail for ipad 9.750 looks a little bit weird, but the plastic on the front looks good."
It's the right product!
It's a masquerading color. It's definitely leather.
"Thank you, Tiki!"
Nice leather and quality. The shop is very enthusiastic and supports the exchange of other skins when the first skin sacks don't fit with the Ipad... will continue to support the shop...

"Good stuff, like him, doesn't take long to find out."
"Well, at this price rate, okay, cover for all ipad 9.7 inches, so there's some details that don't match the ipad gene 6, but it's acceptable."
I can't put it across. It's awkward.
"Advertise is available for the iPad Pro 9.7inch, but if you put it in, cover up the top speaker, the back camera doesn't match, and the flash is completely covered."
"The product doesn't have a stiff neck to build a movie or learn a lesson, it's not really convenient."
"Oh, look at the red one."
"It's a pretty solid package, it's a plastic bag open, but it's a little sad that the plastic rings that hold the machine don't fall off when they're light, the skin's okay, it's easy to slip away."
Can't fit the size. Want me to text you back?
"It's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, but a horizontal edge isn't tight."
"I put a green one and a pink one at the store, and the owner gave me a golden one."
"Tiki's so boring, I'm on the tiki table"
The skin doesn't encourage ipad.
How many skins do you buy if your back's blown off like this?
It's normal. It's not hard.
"It's tight, it's perfect, but with the smell of plastic, I'm still having that smell for a month."
"Red doesn't look good, and pink doesn't look good."
"Found the same store as ipad pro 9.7, which, when using a flashlight, is covered up by phthalates."

"There's no way you can open the screen, you can't breathe in your own screen."
"It's not flat, it's channeled."
It's funny to put the big one in the little store.
There's no point in it.
"Not exactly the description, but quality is good, recommended."
"The product is OK compared to the price, and the red is quite beautiful."
The opposite color hic doesn't swing like the picture.
It's normal. It's expensive.
"Case's pretty heavy, I'm a little loose on iPad Air2, I've got to take it off because my hands are tired."
I'll buy the wrong one. I'll give you anything else.
Case's cover isn't sure when it's moved.
It's a beautiful model of quality like advertising.
When closing is not tight and does not turn off the screen as advertised
I can't breathe anymore. I can't breathe again. I can't breathe again.
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.
"The product's good quality, plastic, has magnets that open the screen."

"The package is well packed, the delivery is scheduled, the call is given in advance, the quality is being used, the quality is not being evaluated."
"The machine's good, but the engine's side button looks too broken, so if you can turn off the source with sensors on the machine, that's good. And it's hard to use them at night."

The product is exactly like advertising.
It's too easy to break. I fall once I can't turn the machine back on. It's not cheap. It's too easy to break.
"The machine that can use the machine can't get on the screen, expect the shop to respond and take responsibility."
"I got the package but couldn't read the FLAC format as in advertising at parameters; the screen didn't have the touch, only parts of the keypresses; there were no GPDs. The accompanying ear didn't look good."
Some mp4 files are unreadable.
"The silicon wire on the picture is slippery, but when you get it doesn't look the same, it's untrustworthy, and it's not happy about the product."

It's a lovely microphone. It's worth a lot of money.

"It's okay, Loa, to listen to the music. It's okay because it's not a scream. But when you sing, it's a little small."
"Quick, stable, but small sounds. If the volume of music is loud, it's hard to attract the sound when you sing karaoke."
"Pack it carefully, deliver it quickly, but the tone is too small to be disappointed."

"I was trying to put it on the phone, and I ended up having a flat, and it was so tight, it was hard to put it in."
It's a nice hug. It's very close.
"It's so light, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice."

"Well, just now, but taking a flash is a lot of reflections, so it's not going to go off, but it's going to be okay for you to take less shots, to film."
Check the product correctly. The phone model is in use. We need to re-commended.
"The quality fits the price of products, shiny back, and too slippery to leave too many fingerprints."
It's okay.
It's not good. Put it in the air. It's not close.
Good at price range.
Okay.

Satisfaction
It's exactly the description. It's beautiful.
Acceptable at a price range.
Standby.
"It's hard to paste. With two wipes on the outside, it says step one is wet and step two is dry, but both wipes are dry."
What's so small?
"It's a joint guide, it's hard to stick, it's a stick, it's a dump, it doesn't stick to the face."
The product's terrible. Sticky. I'm not sure.
"I'll take duoc, the stickers don't cover it."
"Rows like descriptions, quick delivery, good use."
Don't buy it.
"It's a small charge, it's a pretty nice style, it's very secure, it's a quick charge on the phone, it's a really fast delivery for two phones."

The cable works.
It's good. It's good. It's good.
"The image quality is good, the plughead fits the screen"
Good use and great pleasure in sp
"It's exactly like advertising, beautiful cable, everything's fine."
"I didn't look very closely, I got a computer connection wrong, and I don't know if the store is going to support the exchange."
It's about two months of use. It's okay. It's a tight end.
"Nice Sp, well-advised, sure-looking, two shiny gold-plated heads, very pleased."
Okay.
"Tiki delivers it quickly, but the mail back has failed, and the number of broken errors that are still sending it, although it still works, is very uncomfortable to wear it in the middle."
Great. There's no place to go.
"Okay, smooth, good noise resistance, medium negative, fairly flexible, a little heavy."
Temporary. A regular drop of liquid lids.
Wrong intersection set colour
Nice.
"It's a very convenient two-foot-and-a-half-a-half-foot-long multi-party pole that's used for many purposes, and it's very, very smooth, everyone should buy it."
Good quality. It's hard to paste yourself without experience.

It's exactly the same as the sample.
"Bad connection, short-term even standing pretty close."

It's good. It's good. It's good.
"Nice, neat, convenient, tiki now delivers super fast"
Fine.
I'm fine.
"The rope is good, it's not stuck, it's good quality!"
"The connection is stable, and by the way, plug in 1 and out of five, the plastic is light hand-holding, the wire is big, it's secure, it's unmovable, it's convenient, it's fast."
"It's very satisfying to spend so much good, always using Mac to buy the main stuff, it's good to buy an ayf for some equipment that includes live lights, oranges, mics, and other heaters. It's good."
"Fast delivery, well packed, whole set, good use, satisfied with the product."
"Connect OK, steady, multiple ports, tegiesu hdmi"
"The stuff's okay, but it doesn't mean it's got a wire plug on it. Finally, the boss yells at it."
"Very pleased with the product, carefully packed."
"It's good, it's light, it's nice."
Okay.
"Small, well-connected"
It's real cheap.

"The product's right, caauf."
That's good.
"The big, hard wire. The fast line."
Very Good!
fine but unable to connect to the connection head of ugreen
Okay.
"Sim got hit by the drop for almost a month, but the shop started to text in advance and send a check for a month, so it's okay, just check every month, so we don't know if it's even a year, but Mobi's waves are fast, even though it's only 4Gb a month, but Mobi's waves are faster than any commercials."
"Buying from the shop three times, for the first time sim viettel used it very well, the second sim mobi is also very OK, the first three mobis use ok but now sim doesn't accept any more"
This one's a cheap one.
"The delivery is fast, sim 4G has already activated."
"I check the speed several times, I see an average of about 5mbps, I don't know how to check the capacity and date of use."
"sp is like described, packed carefully, delivered quickly, well-used, support shop!"
The delivery is fast. <i>The sim is 4G and sim is ready.</i> <i> Sim 4G.</i> <i>The company itself is great.</i> <i>The Shop is very prestigious and counsel is very passionate.</i> <i>To the 5-star shop.</i> <i>It's very popular.</i>
"The speed of the network depends on the time of the KV, and you buy it for the gentle, easy use of older people."
"Fast delivery, good product, fair prices, quick delivery, good good goods, fair prices, coins."
"I haven't finished it yet, so I don't know if it's the right time. Of course it's the right thing to give you five stars."

"Quick delivery, full-on trigger support."
"Call the mobifone check and the information is exactly the same as the description. OK, the network is fast."
This product is sim 4 g whole package one year comfortable use and not worried about stumbling when watching on YouTube
"Use less than 4 months of bad sim, let's get rid of the sim."
"There's no instructions to check the sim packages and timeouts, so I don't know if there's even 12 months left."
"Sim's using it very well, using it on the Internet. Okay, compared to the demand and the price."
"The sim works well, packed well, delivered quickly."
May I ask if Sim now has an extension when he lasts a year?
The repeat sim is okay and the k pit checks on how the trigger works.
"A fitting price, slow but earnest support, right at the heart of the matter."
Good work.
"Sim's got it on right now, strong waves, steady speed."
"Let me ask this sim to buy isn't active yet, I don't know what the effect is when it comes to that, shop."
"Quick delivery, identical product, thanks to the shop, it's gonna help me check the trigger date with you."
"AE should buy.k sim very well, good at the price that 12 months is left."
"It's actually not very stable because the mobi where we're in isn't fully covered yet, but it's fast where the waves are."
"It's good, it's good, it's good, it's cheap, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's cheap, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's cheap, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good."
It's very handy to use and deliver fast.
"It's like I've been used for a day and I can't afford anything, the store's not prestigious. Don't buy it, don't buy it."
"Super-speed delivery. <i>Honday night, t2.</i> <i>Toy shop already delivered.</i> <i>I hope sim works fine.</i> <i>Year for speed.</i> <i>I'm sorry.</i> <i>I'm sorry.</i> <i>I'm sorry.</i> <i>I'm sorry.</i> <i>I'm sorry.</i> <i>I'm sorry.</i> <i>I'm sorry.</i>I'm sorry.</i> <i>I'm sorry.</i>"
It's pretty good. It's acceptable.
The price is reasonable. The price is stable.
"Okay, thanks for the shop."
"Got the goods and we're using them, we've been online all day and still feel smooth."
The network is strong and stable.
"Yeah, well, thanks for the goods. Thanks for the store."

"Use it well, sim only activates five days' worth of time, so it's no problem."
I've always been pleased to buy things on Tiki.
It's not a problem.
"It's good. It's good. It's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good."

It's so much savings.
It's good. It's good. It's good.
I've got it. I've got it. I've got it.
"Good signal, bitch!"
sp good
good use
Okay.
Okay.
"You know, I'm just trying to find out what's wrong with them."
It's okay. It's okay.

Good.
Good.
Very good
Okay.
"You can buy sim for almost a month, you can start off with pretty good, but when you're doing 5 grams of high speed, you can't actually go online, not just lower the bandwidth?"
"OK sim is the right description. Put it in there. The date of the month is the 30th. If the trigger date is 30/10, I don't have sim mobi, so I can't call the operator. Hopefully enough 12 months."
"I'm not satisfied with shipper's attitude... but I do have an address in Germany... but receiving it in peace... because it's in the middle of the 2P, it's easier... but it's less than 200 meters... but it's more like shipper's attitude is like another province."
Sim has four hours a month of high speed. It's four hours of high speed. All that's left is useless.
"I bought the SlM 4G Mobifone MDTKA package one year, and sim activated before, when I got to call the time check switch, and there's still 10 months and 15 days, there's less than one month, and if I split it by 10,5 months, it's not cheap."
"Sim was activated on January 20, 15 days, but he didn't need to use much, so he's fine."
"Sim puts in a network but doesn't log on to my mobifone, so we can't check how many months left, ask the shop, the butter shop, twist it, tell them how much it's going to be sold to the customers."
"I get it every day -- October 16th, after four days of installation. The sim is reported to be registered to private information, because this session is pressurizing and I'm relisting it for 25K, I'm going to check 90, I'm going to be in the second period, I'm going to be out of cycle 2/11. That means it's going to take 45 days, I'm going to be out of September 2020, I'm going to check with apps, I can only check over 90 (200/15). The Internet is going to be fine, I'm just around the center of SG, I'm going to spend a little bit of time, I'm going to the same time."
"Sets daily August 8th, triggers sim on May 23, 15th, *** on sim different from on the machine, into app mobifone reports *** incorrectly, the ability to sim is not accurate"
"The use hasn't been for a month, but there's no fast speed at all times."
"Very bad, my first mate thinks it's possible that the sim was activated in the first month of the first month to run out of high speed that it didn't have."
"Shop changed sim data mdt 250a 4G /12 Mobifone, according to my demand to deliver the correct order because before delivery of white sim! dv delivered slowly!"
"4G is a bad speed, it's only temporary, for 4 stars, for the price, for the price, for the money, for those of you who need a strong network should consider it!"
I've bought three days of Tiki and the shop to deal with me in a hurry!
Four hours a month is too little.
"Sim's good, but the old sim isn't new, and the speed's fine because we don't have 3G, we don't use that much, so that's the way it works."
"Buying from November 13th, 2020 to March 29,2021, without any connection, whether it's 4g, whether it's converting sim to another phone, no answer from the warranty, lots of tiki stores, so tiki's gone."
"Sim's gone 1 and a half, Sim's returned to someone else's name, hoping to spend the remaining 10 months, not destroyed in the middle of nowhere."
"Sticking on Oto screen, traveling to the city sometimes the network slows down, but okay within the price range."
I just can't check the package. I don't know how many months it'll last.
"I just got the sim today (30/1), did some research, found credit cards 220,000, limited to 4/2, offered to explain and check for me to use as an ad."
"I bought it for two days, but why would my skin go faster when I didn't use it? I'm very upset about this."
"It's okay to use it before my eyes, but I didn't log on to app My Mobi to check the package, so I checked it with the USSD code for about 10 days, so I got it."
"I don't know where the magazine is, but I can't use it today. I hope you'll help me out."
"It's all good, it's good, it's 4G fast, it's reasonable to buy a year's use."
"The product can't get into the 4G network, chats with a slow responder, no answer."
"All right, guys, keep an eye out for four o'clock a month."
Sim doesn't have a number to get into My Mobifone to check out even though he chose to log in 4G.
"First week out on the street, OK. Two weeks out, two weeks out, four g's out."
"I don't know why sim would pay later, sometimes get a text message with no money. After a month, there's no network!!!"
Sim only spent the first two days.
"The weak network doesn't work, it's boring."
"The sim doesn't work, you ask for an exchange, you shouldn't order one."
"How come you're new and you're 2500d, you're 8/6 years old, you don't understand?"
"I bought it about a week from now, and I didn't find any sd or any backup information on the case."
"There's 4G a month's worth of money, but not half a day's worth of money, and the network won't be able to send it."
"I've used it, I've seen it online fast, but there's some unintelligible announcements about the fee or the notice that it's already paid but it's still used as if nothing happened."
"This check doesn't feel right, does it matter what happens when you buy it for five days?"
"Sims don't have to activate, they can be used when they're installed in the tablet."
"I just bought it on May 3rd, 2021. Why does it last until May 17th,2021?"
"Got the sim, and the introduction is that the sim only goes on for a few days, but the sim just floats for almost a month, and it doesn't matter to me when the sim is cheap, but the shop should be honest with the buyer."
There's no way we're gonna be able to carry out our relationship when we're going to be okay with it.
"Last year we used the ok that this year's sim used too often to crash the network, very slowly."
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.
"The product is used ok, each crime does not answer questions to the buyer"
"Sim, we bought it from October of last year to March this year, and suddenly, one day, it's no longer visible, which means that the two-grained machine is only present."
"It's a year out, six months out."
"Even if you call 900 to check it, you won't be able to call."
"In less than a month, in September, October's first time is over, recommend that Tiki re-control the product."
"Can't check the trigger date, my skin count."
I don't know how much time it takes.
I bought two sims.
It's just a month from now.
The network is too bad for the image. It's hard for something else.
"4g is weak, gg map or search gg can't be seen"
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.
It won't last long. It won't work. It won't work like the last sim we put on tiki.
It takes nine days for the wave to take only four lines more than the last sim that I used.
Sim's a year away from using it for a month.
"You shouldn't buy it, you can't trust it, but you're too disappointed."
It's been a while. The product's okay.
"Bad quality, high price!"
"The sim is too bad it's only been a day that you surfed face, you read yin."
"Ok, quick delivery"
"The network sim is weak, unable to access the data."
"It's cheap, but it's too late."
"I just got an open line of ktbD apps. I'm afraid you're right about a month from now, and I'm really scared."
"I'm sorry, I need some help with the shop."
Network speed's a little slow.
Good.
Fast Accessing Data
"I can use it in two weeks, that's all."
"The network sucks, man."
It's too weak to see. It's not over yet. It's not working. It's getting in.
It's okay. I don't know what it'll be like in a year.
It's okay. Let's wait and see.
Good.
"Connections aren't really stable, although there's still high capacity."
Like
I'm happy to deliver it quickly.
I just bought two sims for less than a month. How come you can't turn on two so far?
Use fine
"I've just received an unalterable installment right before I can wait 15 minutes, but I don't know how long it's gonna take to set up the six d'clock of tiki like I've never been disappointed.)"
"The first month we've spent more than 800 milligrams, more than 3,000 milligrams, but we can't get into the Internet."
I've spent a few days. I've run out of energy.
Three o'clock sucks. The first few days.
"Saigon is new. Okay, but for a long time, I don't know."
"The network is weak. It's been a long time since we've been here, it's been a long time since we've been here, it's been a long time since we've been here, it's been a long time since we've been here, it's been a long time since we've been here, it's been a long time since we've been here, it's been a long time since we've been able to help our clients."
The network can't run very fast. What the hell are you doing? Let's pay for it.
sim buys it all out of circulation.
"What do you mean, you don't tell me the end of the day?"
It's probably because the network is weak.
"Sim's slow-speeded, missed two days' use."
"In the weak network, unable to access it."
It's a short-term network. Can't handle it. It's too low quality.
The rate of the network is very slow.
It's almost over. The deal's over.
"Four grams, the network doesn't work. So let's say, 98k / 4gb per month, one year."
sim can't call or check the account
Okay.
Why do you owe 600k to a shop with this? It's not a medtreya package. I don't know how to use it for a year.
Use ok
One day's use. I need backup.
I can't use one month of sim anymore.
The network is slow and weak.
Descurance
"quick delivery products, activate professional use and maintenance."
Sim mobi is not equal to sim viettel
Don't worry about the price.
"For a year, there's a month to go."
"Many functions, use them as independent as telephones."
The Hsuen connection is stable.
"Okay, ae, I like the wire better every time I do."
"Can't use all the features, product doesn't have any instructions"
"Guys, I bought the sim but when I opened it up here, when I realized I saw a cut mark and I wanted to tell you why it's torn down. So Mr. shipper is silent and he's running fast. I'm calling back, but he's still on the phone five times, but he's not on the phone. So why is this Shop today?"
"Although the shop sends the wrong sim, the consulting shop is very enthusiastic and the sim always should return the shop to five stars, which will continue to support the shop next time."
"Asked the shop to reinstall,ims good, good"
Sim's stable. It's like a commercial. It's packaged.
"Good product, quick delivery."
"Okay, I think we're good. We're good. We're good."
"Opposite speed, prestige, easy trigger"
"It's good. It's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good."
Ok sim can be used at a price range
"Quick delivery, enthusiastic shop, vote shop 5"
The delivery's on schedule.
It's a beautiful number.
"Good please, the network is stable"
Use it.
Quick delivery... good products.
Okay. Please.
Okay.
"The store's fast, but the network's sims are too bad they can't get into the network. People avoid vietnammoile."
"We automatically register for increased services, call for operators at a bad time."
"The speed at heccm is fast, but getting out of hectic is quite weak, and those who buy it at heccm should buy it."
"It's not a good description. 45k a month, it's 25k."
Sim doesn't look like he's high.
There are no waves in the ocean.
I can use it.
"Fine quality, fast charge ipad 40p 60-80% is quite pleased."
He's in the middle of nowhere.
I'm satisfied with the quality of this product.
Okay.
"Nice design, quick charge as expected."
Let's hit it fast.
"Good, quality."
It's okay to use it. No problem.
"Every time you charge the backup charge, you charge the phone for about 10 minutes."
Quality is better than price.
"The tracking device is inaccurate. If the device is not moving, we don't know how to locate it."
"That's great, so buy it, fast, heavy charge, take the dress, bring the C-type wire."
"It's neat, it's simple, it's good for people with a small style, it's good for the price, it's good for the money."
"The good keyboard has no switch. And the k is connected with blutoot up more than you, by the way, still has to use the Otg tool."
"The price of sp is a discount, and it's even more satisfying to add a point and the delivery staff is very enthusiastic."
"Fast delivery, well packed goods, light Case, phone hugs, and a certain feeling."
Nice. Take care of Dt iphon 8. Pack it up. Happy delivery man.
"Op dep, chac, king of fortune."
Okay.
"It's been weeks since I've had a good day, because I haven't been careful, and I've lost my back, and I've been scratching my back, and I like to see it better, but my back looks really good because it's healthy, but it's not rough, and it's always falling off with a dam, and it doesn't have any effect, and then there's a need to find it."
It's beautiful and sure.
"Beautiful, sharp, very pleased"
"Case is better off in the shape, the buttons are well-made, the handle is good, the handle is right in the front and the back is carefully designed to keep the screen and the back of the screen (with KGIPAX) unscrambled whether it's left in a contortion or a whistle). The price is very good for those kinds of shock-proof cases that come from other brands."

"I got it on August 29,230, on the box with the SX stamp on it, 2020, and I don't know if SX's had much effect on SP's life expectancy, but at a price of more than 40K, it's okay."
"It's supposed to be five stars, but for four stars, because the delivery workers aren't good, and I'm happy with my clients when I don't have an address, the beautiful product, the brand-new package, the quick delivery."
"The design was so numerous that when you hold it in your hand, it felt like there was a lack of ostracism and simplicity."
"Ten days only to see that tiki accepts the order, no matter how much she delivers."
"It's beautiful, it's definitely, it's not going to slide and it's not going to be easy, it's actually worth it, it's going to be worth it, it's going to be worth 128k."

It's a good card.
Good at price range.
Okay.
"Old-fashioned memory cards, so they're okay at the price."
"There's a warranty, I've been buying sp since June 2023."
The package is packed. It's not long enough. It doesn't know how long it's going to last.
"The card can't read music, it's too disappointed."
It's fine compared to the price.
"The product's okay at the price point, only one side sounds a little small for the other."
The bass doesn't sound too tight.
It's easy to connect.
Okay.
"The cost of the expensive wear is so uncomfortable that the value of three stars being disturbed by Tiki is so much that I am able to fix them into two stars, and I personally use them to feel uncomfortable while exercising in the house and outside, and still keep the next three stars that bother me for one star."
It's okay.
"Great headset, lots of good features, bass good."
"Thank you, tiki."
"The product isn't as expected, it's hard to connect to the device, short line, zero button."
"Good use before you, exactly as advertised, quality and tenacity wait to find out."
"It's really good, but it's kind of hard to connect with the phone."
"The durability, it's over, it's off, it's off the LG ear, it's the same price as it's going to cost."
Passing through the tap of an amloquist without giving anyone else anything.

"We've tried, good stuff, just like advertising, quality, and we've looked at some of the same products on other websites, but tiki's selling the main product, not the good stuff."
"Good quality, lots of review, very pleased with Flip 6. Tiki delivery is less than a day but well supported, has apologized to the customer and updates of precise delivery and then delivery."
It's a buffalo battery. It's a smooth sound.
"speaker has good sound, hold hands firmly, can connect to app and adjust eq quite easily"
"It's beautiful, it's sure, it's neat to carry me out with you when you're out."

It's constantly off the grid. Turn it on. Turn it off. It's a week ago. It's a week from tiki.
The rest of it's okay within the price range.
"Okay, give me a hand charge."
It's just that the second day is over.
"It's too hot for the IQ, 12, 13, 14, 15 overheating the quality product that's too bad."

"Fast delivered exactly the description, bought sim times 2 pleased with sp"
"Strong network, watch the 4k ferry. When checking with TTTB sends 1414, the date of the trigger is not the date for online package registration, so call the 18001090 operator to check on the trigger date. Thank you for the control shop."
"We don't know how many sims we have, fast delivery, easy use because we have a lot of space, a day of total consumption, two, three, three, three, three, three, three, three, three, three."
"Enjoy your drinks, everyone. It's pretty fast."
"Sim's well-used, fast delivery, warm support shop."
"2 months have been used and sims are well connected. The product just attaches to the machine is possible, without taking any extra steps. The price is good."
"The speed is good enough to ensure the need to use, and the mount is used only because it's activated."
"The quick support Sim delivers quickly, and the HN in SG takes almost three days, and then the store activates, so that's enough time to last in the first month, hopefully one year won't be a problem."
"Sim's good, we can plug it in right now, it's good speed, it's activated 20 days ago."
Network speed and stable connections.
Well... well...
I'm working on it. Okay.
"I've bought the sim here twice, every time I use it, the sim is activated, the delivery is on schedule, the delivery is from Hanoi, but it's fast."
My shop asked me why HCD got to 15/17/2022 so I bought it today.
"The first time of the 45 days, it's been gone for a few days, it's still okay, it's still five stars."
I don't know if you can use it. It's been a while.
"The quality of the network is fine, the waves are good, the price is right."
Cool.
"The sim on the network is fast and stable. When you get the sim connected to the shop over *** to activate, don't miss the date of your use."
"The product is too good at the price, 5GB a day, the gas can't run out, it'll continue to support Tiki."
"Quick delivery, four seconds activated."
"High speed, fairly comfortable use, only small problems were activated almost a month ago."
It's pretty cool. It's cool. It's cool.
"High speed, steady, fast."
"It's okay, Aad."
You have to check the time.
I'm a shop buyer. I'm very prestigious.

The network is fine.
"Sim's on the ticket, OK, but we'll have to wait for the trigger to start using it."
"The first few sims you buy. Okay, so this sim looks like it's negative 600k, doesn't go online, texts don't answer, then calls the phone and asks for the first time you see a girl, doesn't look like the last one, then calls up the second time you're better, but you're lucky you've got it."
"The support wasn't so fast in all conditions, but you work very hard and happyly..."
"Buying the new sim and calling the operator, which has been activated since 20/8, the first month is 45 days, but it's been gone 27 days. Texting the shop is said to have gone on for 15 days, ms dk, which requires 15 days of the first 30 days, not 45 days of 16th of the year.)"
"Sim had a spinal error that didn't have four grams on his swing, tried a lot of things."
Sim's been activated 15 days ago. He's been working on it for a day. He can't get online.
"It's really hard to check if you want to activate a package, My mobi can't log in 4G."
"I don't know what kind of sim you buy about the first few weeks you run, and then you run too weak, maybe there's no life."
"It's slow, losing the 2GB package every day I bought from Vinaphone the last time, and it's hard to use 5GB a day."
"Bad Sim, you guys be careful selling fake things."
"Fast delivery Shop, quality product, 4G not so fast, but it's temporary."
"It's an untrusted store, it's got a day's course. No answer from the store."
"Sim can't call, but he can go online."
Buy sim but get backup charge
"Hurry delivery, get the goods installed immediately and OK, checking the quality and time later, give before four stars"
Got sim but didn't know the date of the trigger as well as the bag of rent
"I just got the sim, and I'm using it, but I don't know if I can use it for a year as an ad."
The product isn't like the fox.
How do we test the date of the trigger and the rest of the capacity?
You'll know how to give four stars so that the shop can sell more goods.
"The rate of the network is high, sometimes a little short."
Okay.
Doesn't support when the customer asks.
High speed package but too slow network
The network is too weak. I can't wait for the store to explain.
The good sim at the price range will continue to support the shop
"Advertising says call, but it's actually kilograms."
Be careful who you are!

"I'm very unhappy about the product I bought, I bought a 4G sim, but on connection, it's 3G, speed is like a cow turtle."
I don't know.
Speed is slow and unstable.
"The sound quality is soft, it's quiet, there's a lot of bass, there's a lot of batteries, there's no batteries, there's no batteries."
"Different lighting modes, even though they're only 60% volume, it sounds pretty loud."
"Fast delivery at 2 o'clock, carefully packed."
It's fine compared to the price.
"The sound's fine, it's connected, the battery's stable."
Good product.

It's not a good shot and it's also a bad idea.
"Packing your kidneys, moving fast, using it, which is 100K cheaper than elsewhere."

It's a good size.
"Good materials, nice colors, pleasant surfaces, put on the table that has very well-scheduled glasses, good prices, suitable delivery, will support the shop"
Good job.
"The delivery is sooner than expected, and the store is more considerately giving enough paper for the past nine hours when it's pasted, and then it's a little bit more difficult, and then it's better to cut the front corner and paste it, and then it's easier to cut it out."
Cool.
It's in good shape. It's excellent quality.
It's all over the sticker. It's too old to stick around anymore.

"The delivery was broken once, and I got in touch, and the shop changed the speakers, and this time the speaker was okay, and I appreciated the responsibility of the shop, and I rated the store four and a half stars."
"I'm busy asking someone at home to take it for me until I open it, and the speakers are shy, and the store is bullshit."
"Well, it's not as bad as advertising, it can't be demanded, it's bought something else."
"It's okay, it's not working yet."
It's not good to be shy and listen to music all the time.
"The quality of my product is poor use, and I'm disappointed in the product."
That sounds fair compared to the price.
"This is the price of nuts, which sounds good at this price."
Offer Shop a VAT bill for the buyer!
A poor quality speaker has a lot of shyness.

"Six hours of hard work, six hours of hard work, and you're running out of time."
The delivery's exactly the same as the samples.
"I got it yesterday and now it's broken, the shop."
It's not good. It's expensive.
The product is too bad to be used.
Nice goods.
"The overall quality of the product is fine, the small minuses for Apple's logo are unweighted, and the big subtraction is that the rubber edge by the left side is still very sharp, can cut the hand, while the other edges don't fail."

"It's not very artful, it smells very warm."
"The thick skin, the beautiful color with fixed T-bands is convenient, but the chromium is more liquid than the machine, the stingy smell, that's easier to use."

"The whole box opens up and sees that the charge has been scratched, the button of the ear button has fallen off, it's stuck to it, it sounds like it's a long way down, it sounds like it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's good, it's good for four stars, it's a scratch, it's a drop button, it's not like it's 100 percent new sp, so it's 3 stars."
I just got it. The connection's only in the left ear.
Batteries run out of music.
The headset's fine at the price.
I'd like to show you how to charge it. I'd like to show you something. I'd like to show you how to charge it.
I don't get pushed out like I expected with an iphone.
"The first time you pick up the earpieces you can't use because you can't plug in the power, and the second time the exchange is returned, you don't have to return the cargo."
The headset's fine for the price of money.
The charge box doesn't go to the battery. Two headsets are sensitive. Ten seconds is that it's kind of a reset.
"Oh, my God, that's a great earpiece. It's a big, quiet shop. It's so corny. It's got some kind of touch on the box I've been listening to. It's been a long time."
"I've tried the product and I feel very, very, very, very, very, very fast delivery, very sensitive, very sensitive ears. The battery is going to last a long time at the average negative level. It's going to be okay."
"The worker's error product, the shop doesn't respond."
"I wonder if one side is connected to the laser top and the phone OK, it's just connected to the compass and the cell, but the other side can't hear, can't connect to any device, can have a bad external error, just bought it, and a few times won't encourage people to buy it, I'll choose a better brand."
"The sound sounds good even though I want to hear the volume at a normal level, but adjusting is only a little bit too small or very large, but even though I've got all kinds of charges that can't show the charge on the display board, even though the charge is a little small, it's still a bt."
Nice headset. Very pleased with the sound sample. It's amazing at the price of a standard store.
"His mother, buys a button on both earpieces, puts it back together, it's dead, it can't start anymore, this shop's full of faces to old age."
"I can't use the headset. What do you mean, it's not on the light?"
"I've heard on the first rung for almost two hours without losing the battery and I've raised a little two, which is about an hour, which is a little bit too long, and it's also too loud for health."
"The earpieces are great. It's good to hear. It's good to hear, it's good to hear, it's good to hear, it's good to hear, it's good to hear, it's good to hear, it's good to hear, it's good to have both ears, it's quick to charge buffalo batteries."
"It's a nice package, but it's dead in the left ear, so the quality's the same."
"Quick delivery time. make sure. will support next time. thanks or good sound method. don't know how to hold it, but right now it's okay."
"The lead screen of the charge box is inactive, the shop is not supported by clients"
I'm having a meal right now. I'm having a really good time with batteries. I'm hearing five clicks. I'm hearing five clicks.
"The earpiece is better than my imagination. For this price, it's pretty good. I've heard it and I've heard it sound okay."
Take the shipments to the power. No battery. I hope it's in exchange for the cargo.
The earpiece is clear. Use it too long. The battery is too good for a price like that. It's going to support the new branding shop.
"I can't hear you, I can hear you, I can't hear you, I can't hear you, I can't hear you, I can't hear you, I can't hear you, I can't hear you, I can't hear you"
"Okie okie tiki just gave it to me. I've booked it for about two days. I've got my first test product. It's okay, it's loud. It's very quiet. It's very cheap. It's very cheap."
It's a very good voice.
Right-hand hearing is very annoying.
I'll give you an example. <i>The phone I've been using for months is fine.</i> <i>The bass is fine.</i> <i>Thank you PKCB</i> <i>Thank you.</i>
It's a nice little earpiece. It's very soundy. It's very nice. It's a five star shop.
"The pattern's fine, but the battery's slow, the battery's gone, the battery's 100% charged, and it doesn't work for more than 30 minutes."
"The earpieces are as big as they are, but they're not shy. You should buy a shop."
"You've got the goods, you've got the goods, you've got the big ones, you've got the blues, you've got five stars."
"Hang does not use dk,ko opens the dk"
"I wasn't sure at first, but I've been working on it all these days, so I bought it."
"The earpiece is secure, the phone is connected to the phone is fine, the laptop is unstable, sometimes delayed."

It's okay. It's good. I can't believe it's online.
It's brilliant. It's an enthusiastic shop. It's a quick delivery. It's very well packed.
"The earpiece is so good, the prestige, the package, the warm, friendly counsel shop."
"It's nice and it's advertised. It's fast delivered. I don't have to try it, so I'll try it later."
"And if you don't have too much money, you can think about this product to experience it very well."
"It's easy to connect, it's good to hear, it's good to hear, it's good to listen, it's good to split up a talent so that the microphones don't listen, they don't listen, they don't hear."
"Okay, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good."
I need to contact the shop.
Okay.
"I'll take care of the order very quickly. I'll tell you what, I'll tell you what, I'll tell you what, I'll take care of it, I'll give you a good headset, I'll give you a good headset, I'll give you a good headset, I'll give you five stars."
I just got it. I can't charge it. I can't get it to the shop.
The package's fine. The connection is fast. The sound is good. The battery doesn't have to wait for time to prove it. tks shop.

"It's okay, it's good. It's good. It's good."
"The high quality sound from the headset is good, but the appearance is a little bit big, and there's no problem."
"New delivery, earphones don't have any batteries, plugs don't go on."
The package's very careful. The main store store is good. That's a nice ear.
"Nice hearing ears, nice style, long-term headsets, very satisfying, very comfortable."
"No charge, no support."
The company's main goods don't need to be careful about packing the charge cable with the full charge. I'd love to use it.
"Okay, handy, long-time wear, no heavy ears, buffalo batteries."
"The product's pretty good, buffalo batteries."
"The weak economy buys this one. Okay. It's always a fair price, but it's a good quality."

"Sim was fine, I used it when I first went to France, but I wasn't lucky enough to forget about the shop, so when I went down to the airport, we didn't have to use it."
"Sim used good calls and data in Europe (German, French, Dutch, Swiss)."
"Got the sim, but we don't know how to wait till we get home. That's the quality."
I've bought the European sim of the shop going back and forth.
"There are 4G, 5G, high speeds, 4G, steady moves, and good luck at the right time to sit on a meter of water, 21 days out of circulation, and it's good luck."
"Sim's well-used, warm support shop, while you're out of the country, still prepport to activate the sim."
"Quick delivery, after a day's notice, good guidance, careful delivery, I'm very pleased."
Backup personnel are fine.
speed 4G in Belgium; Netherlands; Germany
"Quick, easy to use."
"Okay, the price is reasonable."
Can not open message
"I'm going to Europe for five weeks and I'm going to use this sim very handy, and I'm going to run 4Gs, and I'm going to Google Map on it."
"Okay, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go!"
"I bought it on my 15-day trip to Europe, so good with this amount of money."
"Quick delivery, sim's pretty stable, the network speed's only about three hours."
"Sim isn't activated yet --> Requesting to activate is OK, but if there's a problem with the trigger, no answer from the store, I'll just buy the sim of Europe, but only go to Germany, and the waves point to the E -- which is extremely weak -- would never buy it, and wouldn't advise you to buy it."
"In France, using the Crusades, in Switzerland, it's almost impossible to use, send a message 30 minutes later, and in Italy it's completely useless."
"Sim is good at UK, used freely by 25GB, but salesmen don't see VAT bills coming out?"
Bad back-up advice.
"You can go to the place where sim is installed, so you can't take the network by default, and you can't follow the instructions."
"I bought two sims a 5GB, a 15GB, but the general problem is that after two weeks of use and travel to countries as far as Slovenia or Greece, sometimes it's not going to work, but it's going to be okay."
"Sim's using pretty well for 30 days because he's traveling for about three weeks, but the waves are a little weak in some countries that he's going through, and sometimes you have to lose the signal, and sometimes you've got to get rid of them a couple of times before you get the signal back."
"We've got Three, we've got the right European network description."
"Beautiful skin, soft, non-smoking, mouse-smoking, spread out the table in a very nice, beautiful way around the border, pretty good quality. The product is exactly the same as a carefully packed package model. The delivery is fast, put in two days though we're at HCM, shop in Hanoi, the shop is very passionately consulting, we ask a lot of things about the product that the shop is still committed, we give the five-star store that's bought twice, and then we're going to support it twice."
"It's kind of cool, it's nice, it's kind of bad luck, it's a blur, but this price is totally acceptable."
"The underwear is the size of its needs and the package is packed carefully, and the delivery is polite and comfortable, the skin quality of the sheet is as good as expected, the delivery is faster than the date."
"The Shop is very carefully covered, the seams are very careful, both sides can be used both ways."
"Beautiful, thin, synthetic skin!"
"The quality is very good, the skin is flat and the surface of the mouse is very much, and if there's only one or two loose spots, it's probably just going to come down later, but it's not that big a problem, the whole thing is very good, maybe later you'll get a bigger one."
"Nice underwear, thin skin, so it's a little bit of a quick mouse-sweeping, a little bit of office work, and it's kind of thin on the edge."
"The only way to make it is better than the one we used to buy, and at first, the surface was a little wrinkled because the pad had to roll round to share but spread out for a few hours would be flat, very fine."
"The product is fast, it's practically like advertising."
"Half an inch (80x30 cm) Mouse Lot, Pad Antiwater, YORN Mouse Table"
"It's okay, it's the shop, it's got the third one."
"It's taking a while to pick up the good stuff, put it on the table, it's perfect, it's medium, it's very deep in blue, it's okay!"
"Soft pad well fed, packed carefully!!"
"Nice underwear, good quality, smooth mouse."
"When you open the box that smells of skin plastic, the skin should smell normal, and you can use it as soon as it's rolled up, it's a little hard to use."
"The store is fast, packed carefully, the mouse is sensitive on both sides, the color on the outside is fresher than the image, the quality is good."
"Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, sure."
"I don't know if it's real skin, but it's beautiful."
"The good stuff, which is fine compared to the price of this money, each delivery party is too slow."
"It's bigger than our home table, thick skin, very smooth and smooth with our hands!"
"The pad's face is smooth, the threads are fine, the price's good."
"The product saw it. It's been a few days, so that's it."
"It's so beautiful, it's nice, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good."

"It's not all open yet, it smells good, it's two colors."
Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.
"Good stuff, carefully packed."
"The product is very good, the price is right, the package is carefully packed, and the delivery is fast, very pleased with the product and the service of the shop."
"Used for more than a month, it's new, it's two-sided, it's smooth, it's OKie."
Use ok
"I've got this white wooden table, I've got this mouse pad, and I've got Macbook in the middle likes aaaaaaaaaaahaah!"
"Use the mouse to guarantee sensitivity, but if you play the game, it's not good."
I can smell it. I can't handle it. I can't handle it.
"The quality product is good, but it's a little concerned that there's no stitches in the outhouse, so I don't know if there's any damage in using it for a while."
Very good.
It's a good piece of underwear.
The goods and the darks compared to the price.

Nice big underwear. Not too thin.
Nice skin.

I'm fine.
"The product's fine, there's two smooth sides and there's a smooth side, and it's not exactly the wrong color delivery that you need, so I hope the shop cares more about the cskh because we're okay now."
"It's a nice, flat pan, brown front, gray backside, but when the mouse goes slightly, the mouse doesn't climb the body with a piece of cloth."
"I've been waiting a long time for payment, but I've been waiting for it, you know, you've missed what you need, chatting with Shop for days and you don't answer, and it's gonna take 150K without an explanation."
"SP got dirty, hoping to wipe it out, and what's not funny is that sp is a bit of a mess, so when it opens up the crushed sp, it's now being eaten in shape, because it's rolled back and forth, and it's still not straight enough."
"The delivery product's like a model, the line's only made out of borders OK, the color's okay, the two-sided color, and there's a little bit of a defect, and there's some sort of one-and-a-half bump in the shape."
"I saw that the contents of the package were written for the reasons I didn't have for you to report it, so you're talking, and on the bill there's a direct delivery from that sales unit, see the specifics of the order there as well."
"The delivery was fast, but the skin broke open into a long way."
"When the mouse moves slowly and gently on the table, the mouse will be very hard to move, and the friction will be too big to cause mouse surfing, especially when the mouse moves in general, it's smooth, but I really don't encourage you to use this underwear."
"The pink is darker in the picture, not the bright pink."
The product makes the mouse a little less sensitive than the fabric.
"The product says it's 80x40 cm in size, but delivers it to the wrong size, which is incredibly small."
"I ordered a 90x40 size, but the delivery shop turned into 80x40."
"It's not a very visual color, it's the same thing as a description, it's a relatively solid border, but it's a little too thin, and it's not very smooth."
Distortion box. Hard skin. Unlined body. Curved mouse. Hard move.
"The product's fine, there's two smooth and smooth surfaces, so choose the color and tell the shop not to deliver the wrong color on the surface that you need."
"It's not as beautiful as it looks, but it's okay, whatever the money is, it's okay to use mice."
The two roads are just caught up looking bad.
"Use it smooth, clean."
"Good product goes with the price of money, good luck, good luck."
"The underwear you get is black, it's hard to clean, it's a store, it's not checked first, and the quality of the product is fine, hopefully the shop improves."
It's bad luck. I'll give it to the guests.
"The quality's a little low, but it's cheap."
"The product is exactly like advertising, quality is fine! deliver quickly!"
There's a seam of error on the carpet edge.
"The delivery agent asked me to go to the warehouse to get it, vote 1 star delivery."
"I'm black, and I'm red."
"The Shop is boring, and I've got a light blue, and I've got a pink delivery, and I don't have any customers."
"Lot was fine, colored. OK, quick delivery."
"It's kind of slippery on the ground, but the underside doesn't hold very hard on the table."
"A little bit of a rat, and everything else is fine."
"Skin, pretty good."
"It's nice. I don't know what you're talking about, but mice are made of skin, so it's harder to move rats than you think. The next time you'll look at the material, you'll notice the material."
It's as good as a long delivery.
"Four stars, four Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good"
"Oh, my God, you've got a bad cut in your underwear."
"I'll give you 80x30, but deliver 25x21."
"The skin's pretty nice, the water's good, but it's not cut yet, and it's not fine."
It's a price range. Okay.
"The underside is slightly slippery, which leads to being easily slipped while moving the mouse, which is okay on the top."
"The color is nice, the edge is a little stiff and rough, so the hand is not comfortable."
"The product's pretty ok, although there's only a few broken lines."
The product is big and thick. Use it very well.
"It's good, it's easy to scratch, but there's two sides to change."
"There's no slide, there's no sweating."
"Use it fine, but it's only a sewn border. It's very careful."
"Put the black red gray, other than the quality ok"
"The product looks over, okay, package the kidneys, vote four stars because the delivery's a little too long."
Rats get stuck on leather.
"The skin isn't very nice, the color on the outside isn't as nice as it looks."
Okay.
She's on top of it. She's trying to turn it upside down.
The product's okay; it fits the price.
"Not like what you bought at first, but quality is good."

"I'm sorry, it's not easy to get a rat torn out."

I'm not happy about the product.
It's normal.
"No tables, easily moved."
It's all good.

It's okay.
The quality's not what I thought it would be.
You can use both sides pretty well.
"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

The quality is extremely good. I'm very pleased.
"The product's exactly what it's supposed to be, high quality."
Use it fine.
Good reception cable output sound
"Beautiful, useful, proper, and sufficient."
"Ugreen's good, I'm relieved, the price's a little high, but it's a lot of quality."
I'm a little disappointed that I can't get a microphone from my earphone to my PC.
I can't get the mic back on this wire. I can only hear you.
"We didn't get a signal at first, but now we can use it well..."

"It's like a tiki image, and it's pretty sure."
"Beauty, quality, perseverance and cx are worth a lot of money."

Good.
Okay.
It's the right model. It doesn't stink of plastic.
"There's no roughness, no icing, no hard-core, Shop-in-the-art, pack a lot of Styrofoam, and there's a tape warning for the broken goods."
"Beautiful cute cute, beautiful singing and listening to good music"
"Quick travel, real product, very comfortable use."
"The new product is 100 percent big, but three days is getting used to it. It's trying to install, and it's preferable to the shortcut."
A beautiful mouse with all its features
Good.
"The product. Good, long-term battery. It takes a long-term experience to know if it's sustainable or not."
I don't see TIWi coming out of the bill and sending it through my email address:
"The product was broken and I sent out the warranty, but it was explained as follows:"
"Tiki let me ask you, how does this product go? In the box I get no warranty stamp, no warranty address?"
"The mouse's good, but it's big, and click's a little loud."
"I think the volume's a little weak, but it's worth a lot of money."
Batteries aren't that long.
"Bass aren't as warm as they would be, because reading review finds quite a compliment, but at this price it doesn't require more."
"The speaker sounds great, delivers fast, the employee is enthusiastic, and the durability is waiting for more time to find out."
"The price's okay, but the battery's pretty fast, like two and a half hours of pop."
It's a regular sp. Uses whatever money it belongs to.
"I've tried all sorts of music, not as warm as the positive cm on Tiki, but this speaker listens to EDD, but I've got a very slow message with the shop, and I've got to wait for the store to just text the right message and then I'm gone."
It's often disconnected.
All right. I'll be right back. I'll be right back in my pocket.

Okay.
"The product has the right quality of the description, the package is solid, the delivery is fast, it's very expensive for P/s: there's no time to take the picture, so we get the photo up on the Internet."
It's all right. It's all right. It's all right. It's all right. It's all right.
"Superstitious music speakers, loud sounds, warm bass, convenient to carry anywhere else, simple style that's just perfect for me."
"I bought it at the end of July, 2021, and it's seven months now, but I don't spend a lot of time listening to music every once in a while, and now I'm out of batteries, and I've checked it, and I can't fix it, but I heard it in the first place."
The cute little speaker sings loud and loud at a cheap discount. A shipperte is friendly to a thousand-star shop.
"This Chernoble has been very, very connected, very high music has always been good for a student like me."
It's good to see a student speaker. It's good to hear. It's good to see you.
"It's been a long time since I've bought anything so good. It sounds so good, it's so warm, it's so big, it's so good."
It's very enthusiastic. It's all about five stars. The product's OK.
"It's a very good, very good-looking bull battery. It's cheap."
"Out of the blue, you can't think of it as cheap, but you're looking too bright, packaged. Okay, quick delivery."
"I'm sorry, boss. I'm sorry to bother you, boss. I'm sorry to bother you, but I'm sorry to bother you, but I'm sorry to bother you so much, um, um, um, you know, um, you know, I'm just a little bit more than welcome to the shop, you know, maybe you'll be supportive."
"It's okay, it's okay, it's okay. It's okay. It's okay."
"The product is very bad, I can't connect to the desktop computer, I want to return or change the sp, but I can't."
"It's better for the model, and it's better for the banana than for the speakers, and it's better for the max to sound good, and the Tiki star is quick to deliver."
"It's pretty OK, it's loud, it's good quality, it's good shop, it's good service. It's going to support the shop again."
"Good product, beautiful model, sounds very good."
It's too smooth. It's so loud. It's so cheap.
"It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay."
"The product doesn't look like an introduction, the radio doesn't catch any radio!!!"
The package is very carefully packed. The whole package is filled with enough sound quality. It's a beautiful design. It's quite impressive. It's used in general.
"When you turn on more than 50 percent, it's off."
We've got happy friendly employees. <i>The packaged product is 100 percent.</i> <i>The sound or the feeling is super good with this product.</i> <i>Let's do it.</i> <i>Let's do it all the time.</i> <i>Let's do it.</i> <i>Let's do it.</i> <i>Let's do it.</i> <i>Let's do it.</i> <i>Let's do it.</i>
"The speaker's fine, but according to the shop, the first charge took 24 hours, the next time I didn't know. Texting the shop was slow."
"The volume is relatively good, there's a wire on both sides that's consistent with taking away."
"Nice little speaker, low cost of sound good, batteries that can be heard for quite a long time with good connections, will introduce to your friends to buy."
It's a fast delivery store. It's very good. It's very good. It's open.
"There's not a single piece of instruction available, it's pretty loud, it's been looking for a sound cut all the time, but without it, Tiki knows where the sound is, that's for her, that's for her, that's for her, that's for the heart attack!"
"The sound sounds good or the battery's connected, but everything's normal. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay."
"It's solid, it's good looking, it's nice, it's nice, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good."
"The sound is loud, the connection is fast; however, the volume buttons on the machine do not make a small adjustment. When the computer does not turn on the music for a few minutes, the speaker automatically disconnects the connection, which is a bit annoying."
I just got the package. It's so loud. It's so good.
"There's no sign of a pretty machine error, of a schedule delivery, of a carefully packed package."
"The speaker is really good after the trial, and I'm saying that long time-term sound batteries are so good that it's always good compared to the price, fully functional."
"It's very OK, or it's a nice, warm sound, the second time you've ever bought a store that's always good."
"All right, let's make it quick. All right, all right, all right, all right. All right."
I've got 6W. Just tell the phone.

"It's not a skin, it's a front and a back solid plastic, but it's enough for the need to protect the Lindt Paper Gen 10, which is very light if compared to old 2013 Paper, which is very heavy. Coover also has a magnet so that once she flips cover up, she still closes and activates the screen when it opens/ closes. Another point is not good or bad: cover doesn't completely cover the back of the machine, on top and under to expose the machine."
"It's not a skin, it's a front and a back, but it's enough for the need to protect the FOXO machine."

"It's a little tight, it's kind of hard to get in, it's a beautiful design."
"It's beautiful, but the gray is sore, and it's light brown, but I'd love to, it's okay, thank you, tiki."
"The product's a perfect fit for Arborlon PW, who likes Tiki to deliver fast and buy"
"10 out of 10. The beautiful skins, when turned on, the machine turned on itself, when it was closed itself off, and then the skins would go on and get the new ones, and the code would be beautiful, and it would hold itself tight."
"Nice form, catching eyes, protecting your machine. It's more polite to let the machine be naked, but if it's still a little high, then it's okay."
"I've just bought this product, along with Alyssa Gen 4 10th 2019, and I don't think it's going to fit in that Kindle, and I've been in touch with Tiki, and I'm asking you to thank me for all the shopping on the floor."

"It's just right and it's got a screen lock when you fold it open. With a bit older than a concave screen down, you'd prefer to be exposed, not covered, but with PPW4, you'd need this to keep your hand off the screen."
"Review detail for those in need: - form: catch the eyes, black the shape, short the pocket. underline: wait three days for delivery to be delivered (some must wait too much)."

"The product's a prototype, it sounds good, but it's good to hang on, it's always hanging out, it's going to be a four-star shop."
I just bought two days before my hand mics kept talking very quietly... so I could ask for a return on my product.
It's a bit of a pain in the ears.
"Quick order. OK. But unfortunately, the Geming foxtone G20 new e. e. it's reversed the left to left."
"Sound hearings are stable, delivery is a day early, full accessories, satisfaction."
"It's good, but bass's a little bad. It's good for games. It's not good for music."
"Well, the headset sounds good, right, right, good direction. If you want to buy these headsets to listen to music, you don't mix 'cause the sound sounds like a nozzle."
"You can't buy it, you can't buy it, you can't buy it, you can't buy it, you can't buy it, you can't buy it, you can't buy it, you can't buy it, you can't buy it, you can't buy it, you can't buy it, you can't buy it."
"There's a bad button, sometimes it doesn't suck, but it finds it's holding and calling siri."
"Packed up a bit of error that good product, bass big"
It hurts because it's big and it's too heavy.
"Nice product, quick delivery, Oke model, long time and further evaluation."
It sounds pretty good. It's just a matter of how often it falls out of its ears.
Beautiful many accessories
It's kind of corny when you're on the inside.
"I'm gonna ask you if there's one side of the product, z, but you're gonna have to ban the extra wire so you can hear it both ways. I hope the shop will be able to trade it for you."
It's hard to hear and it hurts for so long!
"Tiki announced the delivery, but I didn't get the package."
"The package's a bit late, but it's relatively late."
"It sounds about right, it's not very good, but what's its money, bass is pretty good."
It's great. It's great. It's good for the shop.
"Jack, don't listen very well. Big side, small side."
"I can hear it at a price range, but I can hear it for months. I've lost my right ear. I don't know how I'm going to be bored."
It's okay to play pupg.
Bye.
Okay.
I've bought a week and I can't hear both of my ears. I'm really disappointed.
It's kind of soundy. It's a little low for the price.
"The quality's fine, but the hearing's are falling out of the ear."
The middle line is broken. The connection can't be heard.
Hurry up the delivery for me and I haven't even approved it for me yet.
Fine.
It's like I can't take an exam with my hand in my hand. I can't do it. I can't do it. I can't do it. I can't do it. I can't do it.
"Listen, ok, play the codm and the leg sounds a little too small even if you turn on the volume max"
I heard PUBG wasn't good enough.
Fine.
I bought it three months ago. It was broken.
"It's a bad quality. One month's worth of goods, one side of it's not worth it."
"Don't have an earpiece bag, shop."
Leot sound not fancying properly!
different colour intersections
"Uses tikiNow at 10:00 in the morning. It's almost 5:00 p.m. new religion, but it's the quality that should be ignored."
I've just bought it. It's so boring.
Listen to this click on the button near the mic when the music is clear on the iphone.
Good game player. Listen to the music. Get the delivery.
"You can use it more than a month, and you can't use it."
It's not very flexible.
The mic's shy.
"I get the stuff, I see the right ear, and I don't get the music."
Check the order for 870347560 and I haven't gotten it yet.

"It's nice and it's nice and it's expensive, so don't even bother with cheap coffees if you don't like them."
"It's nice, it's sure, it fits into the machine."
"Nice, quality, holding hands, protecting cameras."
"It's nice, it's got a hug on it, it's good to have a high-security camera, it's good to see you."
"It's a nice color, but it's not a nice color, it's a nice color, it's a touch, it's a coded price, it's a down-down, it's a passionate advice, it's a reasonable exchange policy, it's going to introduce friends to the shop. Thank you very much."
"It's received, it's very good; it's beautiful, it's good, it's tight, it's tight; it's not bad; I'm going to take the purple for my wife, but it's out of color."

"The product is almost 200k, the volume increase is distorted with bad looks and hard buttons. The source button is very sensitive."
"Uh, well, well, well, well, well, there's a lot of extra details, speaker parts and microphones that we don't like very much."
"I don't look sharp, but my back looks white or glued the other day, and I bought my Xiaomi phone half of the time, and it looked more neat."
"The size is too small, kiphone 11. It's too disappointing. It takes 200K to use."
It doesn't just fit the source button in return.
"It's dirty, it's sticky, it's sticky, it's the first part. It's so disappointing."
Set iPhone 12 promax to iPhone 10 Set black trans-Siper purple without checking first
What's that sound like when you deliver the product without a speaker hole or a microphone when you don't check the product?

"The bad product doesn't get as fast as advertising hard silicon, but soft, doesn't make it any less difficult for the hands. It's like a normal mouse pad. You should be careful, most people should be careful, most of them are looking at the shop."
"It's disgusting to hand over a piece of rat shit in your mouth, it's boring, it's boring, it's boring, it's boring, it's so boring, it's so boring, it's so boring."

"The delivery is good, the product is satisfying."
"Listen, one side doesn't work."
"But the amount of time the battery is listening to music and talking is only one hour and 15 minutes, the volume to near the average level."
"There's a time of death, there's no noise, there's no noise, there's a sound outside, it's very clear."
"Well, compared to the price, the box battery's pretty bad when it comes out at the same time, and it's zero, and the ear battery's not full, and it's almost out of batteries. It's all right."
"It's loud, but it's got a left ear, it's got to be unconnected, it's not going to come in, it's going to blow."
"Headsets are fine, sounds good, but sometimes it's annoying."
"We'll buy it and then we'll have one on each side, and one on the other side we'll turn it off."
"Quick delivery, nice mistake of peeing from the screen to the earpiece."
"It sounds good, but it's not good."
"I'll tell you what. I'll tell you what, I'll tell you what."
"There's a small ear, and there's something wrong with it."
"It's normal, it's okay, it's all right, it's all right, it's all right, it's all right, it's all right, it's all right, it's all right, it's all right, it's all right, it's all right, it's all right, it's all right, it's all right, it's all right, it's all right."
"This isn't new stuff, it's old stuff, it's no HDD paper, it's a charge box, it's got a scratch on it, it's a broken ear, it's not close, it's not listening, it's an old delivery, it's an error, it's an air transfer, it's going to pay off."
"Sounds good, quality, good looks, fancy."
"Clear compliments, leave little review for the reference: + Small, low, low cost, beautiful patterns, stable sounds, connected to both sides of each other's ears. + minus: - Don't know what the volume is like, anybody knows? - No instructions to use. - The dialogue cannot, the other side doesn't listen to what you say. - Pins (one more hours, no matter how much you adjust the volume you have in common)."
"Oh, my God, that's a great earpiece. It's a big, quiet shop. It's so corny. It's got some kind of touch on the box I've been listening to. It's been a long time."
"I've tried the product and I feel very, very, very, very, very, very fast delivery, very sensitive, very sensitive ears. The battery is going to last a long time at the average negative level. It's going to be okay."
"The box and two ears came out without a battery, and the charge was only about an hour ago. To get close to the connection, both the phone and the laptop weren't aware."
"Both sound and product quality are very good compared to price, and the most satisfying part is the service part of the shop, which is very quick and dedicated to its product."
Q
"Quick delivery store. Got a package. Nice headset. Sounds good, guys."
"The ear is clear, the connection is rapid, but it's timid when it changes its position, the battery isn't as heavy as it seems, but at a price too good, there's no more demand."
"The package is fast. It's really good. The quality of the battery sounds like a long time ago, so buy it."
"The company itself is exactly the same as the product, very well, for five stars, and continue to support the long-term shop."
"Half an hour can't reach 1%, you're going to have 0%, you're going to get high, you're going to get shit."
"I bought electronics in Tiki, but the hearing product failed, and I got it back, but I couldn't fix it."
sp ok
"I'm pleased with the goods, but the whole package is packed carefully. With this price, the quality is very good. And the sound is no more because it's too much of a five-star gift."
It's good at the price. Use it long term. Okay. It'll buy again.
The package is hard to connect and the connection is hard to connect and the music can't be heard.
"New earpieces are broken, charge all night, but no battery."
"The left earpiece is damaged, it doesn't work. Texting the shop is not responding. If you want to change the product, send the Taki request back an error."
"Fast delivery, quality's good at the price, batteries can take some time to evaluate it."
"The earpiece is too good for the price, and the durability will take a while to figure it out."
Quick connected earphones. Easy to connect to. The battery will be a long time from now.
"The battery's gone fast, it's hot, and it's too shy to get blown up."
"It's actually not as much as my hearing, it sounds so bad, it can turn, but does it have to be that bad?"
We'll sell them. We'll give them to him. He'll do the same thing.
"It's got, like, four hours' worth of fucking beans in a five-hour battery. It's got, like, a bad product."
"The earpiece is better than my imagination. For this price, it's pretty good. I've heard it and I've heard it sound okay."
I'm so happy that it sounds good.
"No noise, no noise. I'm hunting sate, so it's worth a lot more than quality."
"The earphones just bought, but they can't use them, they're full of batteries, but they run out of batteries when they're connected."
"The ear can't connect, and the battery's filled up and it's gone for a while."
At the hearing during the afternoon error only the left hand can be saved.
"You can't hear them on one side, you can't sell them like this."
"You buy two months and you lose one in your ear, and the glass goes out once."
"It's the same company where you have your warranty with you, and it's a very good connection, and you know how long it's gonna last."
It's good. It's good. It's good. It's good.
"Big headsets, cute shops, quick delivery, earpieces, easy to carry, easy to use."
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
"sp is unexpected, fast delivery"
"The delivery shop is on time, packed carefully."
It's a very good voice.
"You can't get a connection, you can't get a battery out of it."
"It's exactly what it looks like, quality oke. I'm surprised you're so cheap that you're pretty good at hearing."
"Quick delivery, new delivery, five stars and then use it to see what the quality is."
"I've been listening all day. It's okay, it's okay. It's all right. It's all right. It's all right. It's all right."
"You know, hunting the sate is cheap, trying it for a while. It's cool. It's easy to make a quick connection, and there's nothing to talk about."
It's brilliant. It's an enthusiastic shop. It's a quick delivery. It's very well packed.
"I've bought this headset from the shop. I'm so happy to buy it for you. I just ordered another speaker, and I hope it's okay."
"It's normal hearing, it's even more than flashy, rides a bike, it's a good time, it's a reasonable price, it's a price with the same price."
1.shop is well packed. 2 is a great sound. 3.
"The sound quality is fine. The connection is easy, the style is nice, but the bin's running fast. The heating isn't self- chargeable."
"MPD 5.0 earpieces sound good, easy to use, easy to connect, beautiful style"
"It's loud, it's strong, it's hard, it's strong, it sounds incredible. If it lasts, it's brilliant."
Sounds good. Wait a minute.
"The earpiece is also very small and very handy. When you take it with you, the full box of instructions will be available as best you can for 10 megawatts."
It's a waste of money. It's a waste of money.
It's only 24 hours before the store charges...
"Sounds good, but the battery's dead."
"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
"good quality, can be bought for use, satisfaction in quality and service"
"headsets are worth money, convenience, neat, fashionable."
"Or a warm sound of beautiful design, a quick delivery of goods, and a nice, gooddddddd-Jhiubbbbbb."
The battery's gone. It's gone. It's 20 minutes. The battery's dead.
"Great hearing, very good quality, easy to connect, very expensive to buy."
"The left won't enter the battery, and on the right it will charge 60 to 70 percent."
The product is good. The sound is good. No problem. The connection is stable.
"Well, I'm glad you're all welcome. If you don't mind me asking, if you'll excuse me, you'd better get it. If you don't want it, you'll continue to support the shop."
It doesn't sound good. The charge doesn't work very well.
It's good. It's good. It's good.
It's not working. It's not gonna work. It's not gonna work. It's not gonna work.
"Okay with this headset, like a description like a picture, a sound or a good one, 10 pointsmmm for this earpiece."
It's kind of nice. Ten percent of the volume goes on for a long time.
The expected quality compared to the price
I think it's perfect. It's a very reasonable price to buy online. It's a lot of quality.
It's so cool. Always admit it's online. It's all right.
"The hearing can't be connected, please ask if I can change it or not."
I've got the goods. I've bought the store a lot more times. I'd like to ask the store to give us more discounts. Right.
This one's worth a lot of money. It's a small price. It's a small price.

"After two weeks of use, I have some comments like this: - type of pastage: cute, OK, girls are quite fond of being selfie - sounds: pretty good - wireless CAD connection: it's kind of uncomfortable to keep being unconnected and reconnected if you wait about 10 seconds for non-use, which is that there's no other program that uses Sound - the time used: three hours more than the last time it's written: whether it's appropriate for selfie or practice rather than for people to play or work, because there's no time for batteries to respond."
I can't hear you. I can't hear you. I can't hear you.

A few times have been charged and tried to hear only one side of it. The store needs to be paid due to a related technical error from 050/09/2023.
There's one on the left ear.
"We just received the shipment this morning 21.8,2021, open the connection and listen only to one ear."
"Nice hearing, very good quality."
"I'd like to put it this way: very good product at this price range (I buy it for 300k) sound sounds very good (monos with current music) but on the bass part, it's not very good. It's a little short on bass, because I'm a music player, so my judgment is that bass doesn't sound very good, but it's good to support shop 5 because it's fast and quality."
"Left ear charge didn't come in, turned on to connect ENCOM, that's what the new product was."
"no connection and no signal at all, despite trying a lot of equipment, it's still missing, offering to change something else."

It's hard to start with because you don't know how to use it.
Sounds good. Better than the Bluetooth's ever bought.
The quality product is like advertising. I see this store is selling OK. It's safe to buy.
"The delivery looks good, the quality's good, so I don't know how long the battery's gonna last."
"You know, when you're done with the product, you're always trying to get the first sense of sound pretty good, or you're trying to open up as loud as you can. It's okay.

"Very good. The last time I bought that store, I used my virtual battery in this store. I didn't see any virtual batteries."
I bought an ear I can't use.

"Headsets don't come in,pin's told me that four hours of music is over... 30 minutes' worth of business."

"It's a phone call when it's connected to a dead phone, and it's a very weak network, but it's very clear on the other ear, so it's definitely not the network, so the connection to two phones is the same."
"It's like, it's been a long time battery, it's a good sound."
The delivery is faster than expected. <i>The sound is fine.</i> <i>Every crime is a little more painful than what's hearing.</i> <i>Let's see if it's sustainable.</i>
"Nice hearing ears, smooth use, sure, easily connected, well packed, professional shipper, happy, cheap ear prices"

"Rows, like descriptions, okay quality sounds pretty good or not shy, batteries move three to four hours of volume, sounds good, buffalo batteries."
"The earpieces of buying don't sound good. So, good stuff, headsets, and the charge box sure looks good."
"Thank you so much for your warm advice shop, 5-star delivery."
"Buying one side, disappointed in the product."
Everything's fine - let's see how it goes - he
"I mean, the earpiece or the earpiece or the earpiece. It's kind of soft, but it's also quite sensitive. Okay."
"It's a pretty good earpiece, but it's a pretty easy thing to design a holdbox and it's kind of hard to open the lid, and it's a small one."
"Nice quality of sound, nice style, easy to connect, very expensive to buy."
"It's all right with the earpieces, so it's good to buy it, and the delivery is exactly the delivery description from the place where it's packed will support the shop next time it's purchased."
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.
"hop please. It's okay, it's okay. I don't know what I'm doing."
"It's a pretty nice little design, it's a good sound, it's a good level, it's a price, it's a brand, it's a good feeling of wear."
It's beautiful. It's like in the sample. I've bought it a few times. I like it.
"The price's reasonable, the design's nice, the laptop's connected to the Bluetooth."
"That's 300k. That's too good. That's not much to ask, it's good sound, it's not shy."
"It's not worth it, it's worth it, it's worth it, it's worth it."
"Nice earpiece. There's a soft touch behind your ear. The battery box shows, so I can watch the battery level five."
People don't buy shit.
"All right, sensitive, fast-connected. All right, all right, all right, all right. All right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right."
"I can only connect one side in exchange. Oh, my God, it's only been received in the morning."
"The casseroles, such as torn marbles, early installments of Saigon, scratched goods, and dirty speakers, seem to have been using them. Sounds are good, delivered quickly."
It's been a long time since I've been able to afford it. The new goods store will buy it again.
"It's a beautiful, beautiful design, very sure, worth the money to buy."
Small design. 2 days of use is very OK. Appreciates quality.
"The reputation of fast delivery sounds good. Beautiful little design for 5-star shop, kkkk."
"Good hearing, excellent quality, very good choice."

It's not going to be charged with a loose ear battery. It's not going to hurt. It's not going to eat in general.
Pack up the phone easily. The one that's always sensitive to the 5-star shop.
"The ear's out, the left sounds fine, but the right side is just as stuffy as a battery failure (even though it's filled both ears)."
Nice ear. I don't know what time it is.
"Take care of the package, try it very well, at the price of the store."
"Right now, I'm fine, I'm good with sound, I'm good with code OK, I don't know how long it's gonna last."
The battery's gone. The ear's a little small.
It's okay if you wear it for a long time. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.
The long-term use of lids must have been in general good.
It's okay. It's black and white. It's okay. It's okay.
"Loud headsets, rapid delivery, long ranges, unstable connections."
Hand over the cave quickly
"The headset's stable, the package's well-connected, the package's open-sourced, the product's brand-new."
It's nice and easy. It's very good. It's very good.
"Sure, easy to use, easy to connect."
Nice headset or five star company.
Connection's a little difficult.
Look at the product. Okay for the 5-star shop.
The headset is solid. It's okay.
"It's a little hard to use the first time, but the headset's fine."

"I've collected a lot of earpieces, but this looks good."
Sounds good.
Quick delivery. Sound sounds good. It's tough to find out how long it is.
"Quick-hearing hearing, good sound."

"The quality hearing, the bass music, it's clear."
You can't just buy a kilogram. That's weird.

It's a bad product. It's got to be in exchange.
The product's fine compared to the price.
Okay.

Can't talk through mics.
"The cable that you ordered was one meter, and the box was too big... and the tv lg and the soundbar plug in it was an eARC, not like the usual hdmi cable... but just the ADC, which is as small as the big value."
Transfer speed's good.
"If you hear it for more than an hour, the battery's dead."
"The product is very poor; when you first receive a product, the first one in your ear is not going into the power, the charge charge box (after draining the charge box is no longer charged); and after you get a new sp, the charge box is no charge, and the bottom is TIBN solves the exchange very quickly and satisfyingly."
"It's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good."
"The product is short-term, delivers one ear without electricity, one ear gets two fairies, considers when you're buying... after a week you can't even hear it, you're so angry, why are you all so angry?"
"The product in your left ear can't hear you, your battery is full to check it back, you can't hear it both ways; it's pretty rough on the outside."
There's a line that looks like a very nice description. It's a nice box. It's a beautiful box.
"The quality of sound is pretty good, the timing is fast, the connection is fast, and it's stable, and each charge is too fast, using less than an hour than an ear warning."
The birds...pin 100% of what's out. 0% of what's going on.
It's impossible to connect with any cell phone from an IOS to iOS.
Listen to me. One side down.
I hear there's one side of the store that doesn't answer.
"The ear hears four hours, one charge at a time, the quality of sound is a bit bright, the average sound of a loud, sensitive, quick charge."
That's a great earpiece. It's always a big test. Don't be shy.
"It's a day shift, but I can hear it. It's two clicks."
"It's fast, steady, it's loud, it's corny, it's worth it."
"I don't expect a lot of online goods, but when I use a store, it's too good. It's very good."

I don't know what kind of connection to an iPhone is.

"Good earpiece, quality, nice, easy to use, carefully packed, fast shop shop"
"It's a quick delivery order, it's well-contained, it's pretty good, it's good quality, it's not high quality, it's not high prices."
"The quality is great. It's a very long connection. The battery sounds like four or five hours in a row, and it sounds very quiet and warm."
"It's standard. It's like a description of a moving box that's a bit twisted, but it doesn't affect the inside, so it's still five stars."
"Perfect goods are good, the heat's good at the price."
"I don't know much about good connections, but I know it sounds good."
The bull's earpieces meet my daily need for entertainment.
"The connection is fast, delicious in small prices, so it's easy to go out, the earpiece's very soft, it doesn't hurt."
I can't hear you. I can't hear you on one side.
"OK OK, fine. The quality product is good for this price. It's good, it's good. It's good."
"Use 10 days of unplugged charge for five days' payment, and then throw it away."
"And by and large, it's been a long time since the product's worth of money, and it's been a long time, and it's sound good, and it's okay, and it's okay, and it's okay."

"Nice headset, sure, good ear."
"The ears are fine, but the battery's going to run out."
Copy that. It's cool. We'll buy the next store for next time.
It's a really good earpiece.
"Sounds good, but the battery's a little low."
Good.

"The value of laptop FS089 is an outstanding product with many outstanding advantages, made from high-end aluminum, which is not only solid but also extremely persistent, which gives a sense of stability when it's used. A big addition point is efficiency, thanks to smart air slots that keep the laptop cool."
"The product is done very well, the smooth, shiny surface with rubber pads against the machine guarantees the safety of the machine when using a pretty heavy rack, raising the computer up pretty high in the space when it's used, very well used with the out-chain keyboard is certainly not going to be able to shake the hardware store carefully"
"A nice, smooth, suitable, easy-to-loaded rack, extremely carefully packed, tiki delivers fast"
"The price must look good on structure, it's more expensive than the other ones, but it's worth it."
"Now, I'm just going to go over it with the Macbook, the Windows laptop, it's not worth it, it's a little extra, but it's good to put it on."
"It's perfect. It's a big, shiny aluminum metal. It's very solid. It's also very neat. It's also worth the rice money."

"The quality of the product is quite good. However, the problem is that the design, with this design, is quite rough and if it's difficult to move or to leave it in backpacks to carry. (now the market has some better designs, to meet this criteria at the same price) Besides, the design is forced to use a loose keyboard, rather than to put its hand on a laptop to type in."
"It's easy to use, but it's also good to use aluminum."

It's because I ordered... my product is Airpod 3 and I don't have to change it now.
Quality equal price to

It needs to be changed now.

"I just bought a mouse, I hope I can use this product for a long time."
"Well, the good stuff is cheap. Well, it's stable. It doesn't know how to wait for tg sd."

"The battery's weak, except for 10,000 milligrams, the charge capacity for 6,000 milligrams, which is the correct charge for the battery, which is 3,000mah."

It doesn't feel good to use it.
"Okay, so what's wrong with elephants?"

"It's okay to take the box outside, but the box for the product is ripped open at the same time: (I don't know what's wrong with it.)"
It's like this when you get the box that's been cut off.
"Phone call's OK, but the cskh attitude isn't good enough to text for days with no response."
Getting it back isn't even intact.
Why don't yours have the same box on the picture?

Beautiful goods to buy.
"It looks a little flat, doesn't have a magnet to turn off the screen when it comes back, but anti-ipads are easy to slip if they touch a little bit, so that's it."
"Pack it carefully, the price is reasonable, but anti-ipads are vulnerable and there's no magnets to turn off the screen when it folds."
It's not the right product. It's not the right stuff.
It's not really convenient.
"The product's right, the price's right with the product value."
It's both reasonable and beautiful. There's an ipad 2 without me taking five.
What money is that? It's okay. It's okay.
"It's normal, it's a bit disappointing."
Not just ipad2 as an ad only for mini ipad
It's expensive. It stinks.

"Once the battery's gone, the battery's over eight hours, but the battery's not up, the charge's on, and it won't work."
"Use a week, it's quite satisfying, a subtraction point - the charge is hard to see (small, hard to see)."
"It's all right, it's on hold, it's exactly the same description, there's clear warranty information, Tiki now delivers fast."
It's the right delivery. It's the right quality.
"Nice leather, plastic skin without any fear of scratching the machine, a tray with convenient touch pens, good skin at a price range."

It's only been a week since it's been used.
"There's no magnet lid, there's no off or off on when it's closed and there's no real fit ipad Air Four, there's no source buttons anymore."
"The quality product, however, is that of casa pad pro who provides the position of the pen placed inside but the actual product is where the pen lies outside."

Okay.
"The mouse is pretty good. If you use the office, you see 90g at first. It's not that heavy. But when you buy it, it's pretty heavy."
Sensitive smooth rats don't sound like quick packaged delivery ads that don't have anything to argue about.
"The mouse is quite gentle, smooth, silent clicks feel that they are not yet well acquainted with students, students."
"Rats are sensitive, but not as good as sample 311, because without the silicon layer in the handle, you've got nothing to talk about."
The product's true description.
"The mouse moves smooth, sensitive, soft press. The good product is within the price range."
"Feels good, we'll use it to see if it's stable."
"smooth mouse moves, fine mouse quality"
"A nice, smooth mouse. No noise. Keep your hands at ease. Good price."

It's fine compared to price.
Good stuff.

Okay.
The quality is very finee la
It's delicious.
"Used to buy a Logotech M325 not even a year ago, the Roll was broken. Now instead of this M330, let's see what's essentially a light, sensitive mouse. The nice black box with the mouse, the S/N doesn't match as a subtraction point."
"For the first time, you'll be in good hands, and you won't be able to make a quick delivery."
I can't spend the last few days thinking I can't use all the batteries I thought I'd get rid of them.
"Just got the package, the rat's got a lot of scratch."
It's a frog. It's not an unifyr.

"A small, easy-to-get-holdable, easy-to-go machine design. (Laughter) Sound is a little bit better than this coin line. (Laughter) (Laughter)"
Beautiful design well-fulfilling the impressive number of batteries using one-to-one hours a day sounds like almost a week away from sound or buying online that quality and so on.
"This sounds great, it's really good, it's great, it sounds great, it's good, it's good, it's great, it's great, it's great, it's great, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good to hold hands, it's great power, it's good to use it, it's good to get memory stickers, web, it's good to plug in, it's very stable, it's too cheap for quality."
"Good sound, experiencing Pins, being used at 60%, 45% in an hour. Three hours of battery."
High quality! Soft speaker & fit money
It's very safe to shop at this store. It's all right. It's all right. It's packed.
There's nothing missing in all the packages. The package shop has set up a cover for five stars. It's also a sound for review.
"I'm sure that's a good-looking packager, good delivery, good service. Thank you very much."
The line is overrated. The earnest advice is like a description. It's too much sound. Okay.
Who wants to listen to the high-end line and pick it up? This one has to be perfect.
"It's a really good speaker, it's worth it, it's a great sound speaker, it's a great movie."
"It's a very good speaker, not a very sorry experience."
It's a great speaker. I'm so happy.
The new product that we've been using for a month has been malfunctioning despite using less than 60 minutes a day as a exercise radio service for the young people.
"The volume's a little small, bass's not that deep, but it's okay in the money range."
Pass's a little low.

"Buying on Tiki is too reassuring for quality, super fast transportation, just put in last night, and this morning was received by Wiki."
I'm very enthusiastic.
It'll work!
We've hit three devices at the same time.
Well...
The product is exactly what it looks like.
Okay.
It's a very quiet bass sound. There's a very unstable connection. Maybe you don't hear it a few times. You're too lazy to use it.
"The battery is only 60 milligrams, and it's even lower for the 0%top."
"I feel like my left ear is a little bit more sensitive, but my ears are a little bigger than my ears, so I feel like I'm about to fall."
There's a sound. No sound.

"I've found that Bluetooth Firo has a very modern design, well within the price range, it's perfect, it's very smooth, it's a solid charge, it's a long time listening to music and it's relatively stable, thanks to TIKA & FMGI very much."
"The delivery time is faster than expected. <i>Thank you very much.</i> <i>The product is very good.</i> <i>The package, the FMI</i> <i>The sound quality is too good, the connection is stable.</i> <i>The beautiful, sharp design style.</i> <i>Thank you very much!</i> <i>I am quite pleased with this product.</i>"
"It's very stable, it's very earsy, it's beautiful design, it's quite sharp color, it's carefully packed, it's cheap, it's good delivery, it's good quality, it's very good sound, it's good noise."
"Five: fast and enthusiastic delivery in the TIVA style. Five: FMCA, very good quality, good sound, great bass."
"Very quick delivery, excellent goods, carefully packed, well-paid and professionally handled by TIVA and salesman."
"Quick delivery, carefully packed, beautiful form, stable connection, and excellent audio, I've bought a lot of electronics on tiki and I've been very happy every time."
"Thank you very much, sir."
"We've got the product and we've got the ear, we've got Flipper, we've got the modern design, we've got the sound, we've got the stability, we've got the security to buy the product in the main store."
"I'm pretty happy about my product, and I'm so happy with music, and I'm so happy with my ears, and I'm connected, and I'm very, very modern, and I'm kind of interested in this girl."
"The prestigious Shop, the right description of the product, the main firo, as expected."
"The real product, the whole package, the quick delivery, the good sound, the buffalo battery, the smooth ear and the steadyness."
"It's nice to have a little earpiece, good at the price, buy in tiki. I'm happy to deliver goods."
"The quality of hearing is OK, good sound. The point I'm not satisfied with iPhone 11 isn't really good. Sometimes the connection is permanent, sometimes I'm losing connection."
It's nice to wear. It's really good. The battery's good. It's good.
"I've been doing this for about 60 minutes, I've been doing it for about 60 minutes, I've been practicing for 50, I've got dry-cleaning sheets, I've been doing it for about 60 hours, I've spent 80 hours. (I've got four months, but I've only used it for running, and since I've only heard one session in my ear, it's boring.)"
"OK, good!"
"Great headsets, loud sounds, sounds, smell, I've only seen buffalo batteries, which is between 13 and 16 hours, and 10 percent of the time."
It's very mobile. It's the same thing as an ad that turns on the music. It's almost three hours out of the battery at the same rate. It's about six to seven hours at the same time. It's a little bit more sensitive.
"Listen to me. Okay, wait till later to learn, except for a long time, a lot later than expected, due to some kind of malfunction in tiki, you have to wait almost a week before you get it, but when you get it, it's pretty cool."
"The error product is running out of batteries, it's not working."
It's a good negative. It's a good battery. It's a good ear tag.
"The connection is easy, the contact control feature is very sensitive, but the sound quality is poor, the sound is sour because there is no bass."
"I buy a lot of wireless earphones, but I'm really surprised to hear this music, it's so high, it's so good, it's hard bass, it's all music, I'm so happy, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good."
"It's hard to wear, use earaches, and it's easy to fall even though the three size binder comes with large and small words."
"This is the second time I've bought a store at the shop, and I've spent a long time thinking about the quality of her sister, and I find hearing ears very good, it's good, it's clear, I'm very happy with her earset."
"The back Shop is always good, taking care of the problem quickly, supporting the buyers to solve the problem, so it's very reassuring."
Thank you Shop delivered the exact description and packaged very carefully.
The battery's fully connected. 90%. Half the cards are out of 50%. See how many songs we can hear?
"It's a good product. I've spent the last month judging objectively, and in general, if you don't ask too much about the sound quality of the headset, then it's a great product."
"The sound is as good as I'm told, the sound is lovely, but it's not shy, the quality sounds are clear, the amount of battery is described."
"All right, we've got a week to charge, we've got a good sound quality, we've got a quick phase, we've got a 50% discount, we've got a good headset."
I bought it to listen to the movie so I could see it. Okay.
"It's been over an hour since the battery came out, and M wants to change it, send it back to the address."
"Just got an unbox right now, giving off the soul quality, good sound, great price for 500, thinking I'll stop by and get it, and I'll get it from TiKinko's office."
"The product's too good to be below 500K, I'm generally satisfied, I'm not afraid to drop anything, I'm good, I'm not a music man, I'm good with music."
"Fast delivery, ordered two days already with a package, packed carefully, negatives are OK, stable connections and very smooth sensors are OK, in short, OK within the price range."
"I got it right on the product description, it's beautiful, it's fast, it's good, it's sound, it's okay, it's good against water, it's good money."
"Batteries, compared to products at the same price, finds this product boring."
"He buys his third-grader, he says he's good at it, he's good at it, and he's 10 meters away, and he's cut off, and he's on the phone, and he's good at it, and he's good at it, and he's good at it, and he's good at it."
"The earpiece at this price range is good for me, because I prefer the soundpeats compared to the xiami Airdot Pro One, because it's got 330,0 which doesn't get delayed."
"The package is carefully packed, which is faster than expected on app tiki."
"Good quality. earphones have good design, prices like this are too good."
"FAZI A16 is a lot better than the headsets at the price, especially the negative or, in large volume, unspoiled, healthypin, great buffalo. 10 points."
"Very nice style, fast-connected earphones, sound when you turn it up, you're not shy, you're wearing your ears."
"From a normal user's point of view, looking for a good earpiece for exercise needs, these headsets are worth a lot of money."
"Medium sound, warm bass, battery doesn't know it yet."
The left ear's been disconnected for a long time and rewired.
"That's a bad sound, bad reception."
"It's good noise hearing, it's very smooth, it's smooth, it's easy to connect, it's better than five, it's very smooth."
"Nice pattern, very good touch charge, very definitely no ear pain, very good quality at the price range."
"Quick delivery, loud, smooth sound, as long as advertising."
"The quality of sound is fine, the quality of hearing is solid and good."
"The earphones are good. They don't use much, they don't know much, they just sound good, they're good, they're very good."
I can't get on the battery. I can't use it.
"You can't get it to the power, you can't use it, you can't use it."
"Ten-tenths product, sounds or prices."
"Good good goods, smooth ears, fast connections, approximately 12 meters, long-term batteries, nice patterns, touch buttons."
"Tiki is very carefully packed, five stars, 100 percent battery, fast connected, sound too OK for the price."
"It's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good."

The sound of a steady delivery missing one side of the ear pad is kind of small.
"The quality of sound is fine, but the connection is unstable."
"The packaged product, nice, constant connection ok & sounds great. It's good to be within range."
It's a wonderful product.

"Nice stuff, whole box, fast tiki delivery."
I've been trying on my hardest camera for over a week.
"The delivery is exactly like a commercial, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good."
The reef tot. vegetarian muot. k van de. is buying.
It's good. It's good. It's good.
Good.
Okay.
"The product hasn't been used yet, but when you get it, there's already a cut on the cover?"
"Why do I get the product ""made in china"" so tiki would support changing the product to the correct order?"
"If we don't know what's going to happen, we'll reflect what's going to happen later."
Get the camera. OK.
"When we received the product, the shell was cut off and put back on tape."
"It's very solid, but it doesn't work because there's a line of 2022 modeling, but it doesn't fit."
"It sounds pretty good, but the battery's only about two or three hours as much as the advertising, for four."
"Accepted at price level, no warrants."
"One of the arms cover came off, though."
Why can't we connect the Bluetooth to the headset?
"The product looks like the Saigon battery was about three hours away, but the speaker was a little shy, for four stars."
"This one's good, guys. It's good. It's good. It's good."
The product arrived exactly as described.
"It's good, it's tough not to know."
What's wrong with it?
It's good. It's good. It's good.
Sokay. Music time is over 80 minutes.
"Yeah, that sounds good."
Okay.
Okay.
"It's a nice package, but it's not used yet."
"Just received today, five or six hours in the air, it won't start."
"The delivery is fast, the headset is good compared to the price, the connection is easy, the sound is relatively stable."
"Bluetooth connections, sounds that don't ring a bell, full hearing function, it's appropriate for people like you to exercise."
"It's all right, it's all right. It's all right. It's all right. It's all right. It's all right."
"hear quality, sound good, connectable, sound warm, hear 20 percent sound, still have two hours of battery, not to mention much, but very much with quality."
"sp can only hear the right ear, and the left ear at no time."
"I've got three firms at the shop that are more likely to go to the bamboo so I can hear the sound, the bass sounds not very warm, but it's okay to listen to music, so I don't know how the battery works."
"The best quality of sound, the first time you buy online, is always, quality, easy to use, quality wrap, thank you Tiki you're very pleased."
"You charge it and you turn it on and on and off, and you don't text it to the shop, and the shop doesn't respond."
"Bad stuff, two days' use, one ear short."
"It's all right. It's all right, it's all right, it's all right, it's all right, it's all right, it's all right, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good."
It's not working. It's about charging and opening up. This is the first time I've ever bought anything on Tiki. No use at all. Twozz. You should consider it.
"The hearing ear, it sounds good, but the left speaker is kind of a pain in the ass."
Can't charge.
good product
"It's okay, but the battery's pretty weak, like, two hours or so. I don't know, I buy 100k, so I don't ask for much."
Could not close temporary folder: %s
"We don't have much music, we've already lost the battery."
A broken connection. A sound-smoking spaghetti mic.
The sounds so percolate and clear.
sp ok at the price of the money
"You're a fake, you're cheap, you're brand-new, you hear half the volume, you hear the ear aches."
The earpieces are not connected and open.
"The sound product is small, so it's not suitable for street use; it's appropriate to use in a closed room."
"There's a signal, but it's not there."
Sound quality sounds very good. So let's think about it.
"It's kind of boring, even if it's a discount, you shouldn't buy it, and then you throw it away."
Or a nice box. Sounds warm.
I can't use it. It's too bad I'm offering you ostracism.
"sp's nice. The package's closed. Okay. It's not a source button, but it's not a source button."
Good.
"It's so cool outside, it's got warranty."

"I've experienced two times Tiki Now, twice as hard as I need to charge, and this time I need more than enough of the product, I have to cover the shock, I've got to use it to know it, but I've got to know it, but I've got a good hand holding, I've got a good surface that doesn't lose the macbook CS, and what's amazing is I've got to do is plug in the lights and it's gray with my machine, and I've got a hard drive and a rat."
"Can't be used, plug into an unregistered machine"
"Buying the third time, it's going to take the owner two days later."
That's exactly how it's described. It's been successfully activated. It's very satisfying.
"sp ok, good service, easy use, but fade home dk sim network"
"Ok row exactly as advertised, quickly install the owner, just why not app mobi"
Sim ok. Make quick delivery.
"This sim has to be registered to a lot of people, and the network is blocked, and all day long it can't be activated."
It's complicated to sign up.
"A quick charge full of batteries with only warmth, a full delivery house, a package package, Tiki's delivery on time."
"Worth money, steady quality."
You're not even sure about that?
"How beautiful it is to look at the peacock so meticulous and sharp, and fit into the machine, it's worth it!"
"Give me the wrong delivery and ask for a trade, will you?"
"Fit to the machine, no vertical feature, but it's pretty good, smooth skin."
Nice goods.
"If you're wrong with the product you bought, buy a leather bag 13 pro mak again deliver an iphone 13."
"The PU's skin is fake, and it's a few days away from breaking up, and it's not worth the money."
"The pillar's a little thin, the quality's fine."
Good.

"The machine is good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good."
It's great for a speaker like this.
"Big sound and quality ok, worth the money, so buy a mini speaker no less than a loud speaker, and you're going to back up the shop."
"I'm sorry, boss. I'm sorry to bother you, boss. I'm sorry to bother you, but I'm sorry to bother you, but I'm sorry to bother you so much, um, um, um, you know, um, you know, I'm just a little bit more than welcome to the shop, you know, maybe you'll be supportive."
"Good product, beautiful model, sounds very good."
It sounds good. I like 10 points.
"It's small but it's loud and it's easy to travel, it's easy to hunt, it's super love."
Nice.
"Well, the good stuff's good, and it's good, so I'm gonna give it to the 5-star store, and I'm gonna give it to you five more stars from the service shop."
It's beautiful. It's loud. It's loud. It's loud.
"You know, I just got the package, and I'm going to get it right now, and it's a great use speaker, but I don't think we're gonna get it at this price."
The construction speaker is fine. It's certainly too cheap. It doesn't require much more. It sounds good.
The speaker is within range. The speaker is satisfied with five.
"It's cheap, it's small, it's easy to give a bag, it sounds pretty good to me, it's not awkward, it should be bought."
"Sir, I'm sorry to bother you, but the package is okay. The speaker can't hear you, but it's sound."
The sound quality sounds pretty good. The room is 10 meters good. It's fine. It's fine.
Okay for that price.
"It's on speaker. All right, let's charge it once. It's been a long time."
Quick delivery. Packing shop. All right. No microphone.
"I've used it on the store before, so it's okay."
"It sounds good and good. Well, I don't know how long it is, but at a price like that, it's okay."
"It's OK, shop. Five for the shop."
500K worth of speakers or speakers
It's reasonable to say the price is always good to use. I don't know if the next time we use it is sustainable.
"Just give me a little bit of time, and then I'll take care of the details. And when I get this, I'll be okay."
It's a nice stereo. It's a nice model.
"Good speaker, excellent quality, steady hand grip, happy quick delivery shipper"

It's a great speaker. It's definitely okay. It's small and easy to hold.
It's too small and it's a bigger sound than we'd expect.
The delivery looks so good. Okay. For the 5-star shop.

It's a great speaker. It's a bag full of money. It looks nice.
Great.

The speaker at this price is okay.
Don't say more than five for quality
"The product that's been on the market for a few days doesn't work, the product doesn't have a warranty, the store store and tiki don't have a clear warranty information."
"The sound quality oke is within the price range, but the purpose of buying about using music in web and memory tags is to listen but is not to be able to use the web slot and memory stick."
"Two times the power's down, the charge's still on, but the speaker's not on, the power's not on!"
"The sound quality is relatively good compared to the price, the buffalo battery, every time you turn on or off loud, no volume adjustment."
"It's a shame to buy a song and then to break it in five notes, and it's a total loss of money."
"Poor Loins, tell everyone not to buy"
"It's a bit shy, but it's nice."
Long-term usage failed to shut down speaker. battery error.
I can't hear you when you're loaded.
"It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay."
I've spent one day talking.
It's too lame. It's too boring.
"Okay, blue."
Okay.
Okay.
It doesn't sound so small. It doesn't sound so good.
"This price is very, very, very good."
"Sensitive screens, dark colors, sensitive pens!"
It's pretty good how the batteries are changed.
"The complete cap is very sophisticated, the high level of detail, with a very bright leather bag, and my girlfriend likes this sp, the sound is fine, inconsistencies, the quality is off the table, the company itself should buy it."

"The mouse head is a little lower than the table face, so the handle is not very comfortable with long control."
"After six months of battery use, I thought the mouse broke down, so I beat it several times, except two stars for the battery and plus one for the durability."
"It's a very tight Bluetooth connection, unlike any other mouse we've ever used before."
"I put the pink mouse, but I sent the white mouse, which I didn't want to change, but I didn't want to be happy, and I hope next time I don't have to do this."
"I bought it in early February 2022, used it well, but in March the mouse doesn't have to eat the order."
"I'm using the macbook, I'm going to connect you. OK, I'm going to go through the blues, I'm going to click the mouse, it's going to be very small, I'm going to use the mouse speed, and if you don't ask for it, it's going to be okay."
"I'm texting the store and saying that the package wraps the air with sure, the shop, yes, but it doesn't do it."
It's only been three months since January. It's been paralyzed on the right.
"( 1) Mouse quality is too OK. 2) This time, the store and the transport unit handles the package too slowly."
"Fast connection is stable, the mouse is too long. It's a bit of a pain in the hand."
The connection is smooth. Click it nice. Colors seem nice.

"The first one's okay, the second one's too disappointed, the second one's down, five to five, the machine's too hot, the music's too loud, but you don't see what's broken."
"It's nice stuff, people. It's much better outside than the picture. I'd like to buy white and run out of goods."
It's the right model. It's a prestigious store model. It's a very good quality. Okay.
"I've tried the product and I feel very, very, very, very, very fast. The speaker sounds very good. The battery sounds like it's going to last a long time at the average negative level. It's going to be okay."
"It's a fast delivery store. It's packed carefully. I've got a friend who bought it at this store and introduced it to a store. It's okay to try it out, so try it out."
"Fast delivery, careful package. Sound's fine compared to the price of a small space."
"The quality of sound is compared to the price of money, easily connected."
The quality sounds warm to my mother and says it's good. It's worth five.
"It's a fairly stable sound at the price. It's a small room meeting. It's a neat design that can be brought out. If there's a need for entertainment or video viewing, it can be bought."
"It's a really good product, beautiful design and a really good hand. Sounds good, and it's cool. It's good. It's good."
It's a cute little speaker. I love it. It's easy to carry it with me.
"It's okay. It's the right price. Good family. It looks good, it's stable, it's stable, it's sound good, it's not shy, it's okay."

"Tiki's delivery was as quick as Tiki Now's commitment.The box is intact with the wire of the device, the OECD, for the next hour or so, when the wire is black, it's lucky not to make a fire. <i>I don't ask Tiki to change the package, but I'm asking Tiki to work with the supplier to secure the seat.</i> <i>If someone's leaving the house and forgetting, it's a huge risk of fire.</i>"
Too Small
"Simple, sound good."
Excessively inconsequential
It's a little smaller than I thought it would be.
Listen to a kilogram of bass want to be traded for this. That's a two.
I can't hear you. I can't hear you. I can't breathe. I can't feel the battery.
The product but the pattern should not be caught
I don't know yet.
The loud volume player will be squeamish and will not listen
"It's all right, but hurry down to the bin."
He's a little shy when he hears the mid-level.
It's okay. It's small. It's worth it.
Use it fine.
I put gray blue and dark blue.
"The package is very careful, the delivery is fast; the device is well-fulmade, it feels good; the record is relatively good in small space; the outside is small; the machine doesn't see any card or stamps, so it doesn't understand how the malfunction will be maintained."
"Pack your bags carefully, make sure the audio is clear, the interface is easy to use, the strength is still waiting to be experienced, and Sony's hope is going to last."
"The company's main machine, it's well packed, it's stable quality."
"The product in general is good for the family to be able to buy, but it's important to choose a house that's under positive judgment."
"Sony's own goods should be very good, packed carefully, delivered on time, friendly employees. Five stars!"
"When you don't want to take note, this one's best."
Good.
"The product has good audio quality, it's connected to the computer, it's easy to move data files, it's pretty convenient for old-time recorders."
Good recording product...
I love the machine. I still like the batteries. They're all out of action. They're good recording machines.
"The machine, the full box ae, uses the 1.5V battery repeatedly, it's about 11 o'clock."
Good.

Records are fine. Light and clear.
So good
"You're gonna have to change your battery for half an hour, you're gonna rip out a new battery, you're gonna have to move this store!"
"The delivery was quick, but without the company's warranty, everything was fine but a lot of noise, not yet filtered to separate the sound caps."
"Used over a week and used it very well, but then the virus ate the file. If you plug it into a computer with a virus you can't copy the file, and the tape recorder gets infected, or you can use enough software, but you still can't fix the tape. You've sent it back to the maintenance company, you've found the case, and you can't write it down to the computer. In the end, you can use it, but don't know it's a good day, but it's a clean day, don't worry about losing the files that's important."
"The receiving looks like a temporary function oke after a while will reevaluate, but the external sensation is a bit scratchy."
"The delivery on schedule, the package carefully, the samples, has gone fine, waiting to see how long it lasts and how long the battery uses."
"The machine's too loud. If it's okay, I'll give it back."
"*** Try it ok, but without a strap, no plug-in cable to convert data through a computer / phone"
Not as much as I'd expect.
Okie:p
No cell phone recording quality:
"Nice machine, good record quality."
It's been almost a month. It's okay now.
Okay.
Use it well...
"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no."

"It's too expensive for the quality, without the charge cable, not to buy."
"The underwear should be the same as the description, and it should be based on the keyboard size to select the tile size. If the keyboard is full, so that a section of the mouse setting should select the maximum size."
"Colored like, quality's fine, quick delivery."
"Smooth surface, easy to move"
"Nice colors, competition prices."
quality-valued
"It's bigger than I thought, but it's pretty good, so I'll buy it."
"It's thick, smooth surface."
Use it fine.
It's very nice. It's got a speed switch.
"Rats are good, also nice. But the instructions are all Chinese, so I don't know how to install or customize, I hope the shop is looking at this problem."
Right mouse to describe
"The delivery is on schedule, nice wire and sound is fine."
"The sound is good, it's consistent with all sorts of music, it's smart design wires, and within 300K, it's a nine-tenth quality headset, and it's going to go for the shop next time."
I can't hear you outside. I can't hear you with your ears on.
Sounds good.
"The delivery is too fast, it sounds good, it sounds good, it's warm."
Fine.
Okay.
The sound is very good quick delivery very good product quality very good
Fine.
Good ear. mic's okay.
"Good quality, I'm very pleased."
It's good to spend it so long.
I don't know.
"It's mostly used to check sound when you're on camera, so it's not much to ask."
Stand by the price range. Sound's fine. Mic's not good.
We're good. We're good. We're good.
It's a nice charge. It's too fancy.
The company's own pawns are cheaper than international goods.
I'm sure it's beautiful.

"I don't think a cheap product that wraps up better than a telephone wire, looks at the degree of perfect sp quality, hopefully lasts long, basically okie!"
"Superstitious, good sound quality, easy to connect."
"I love to design speaker cylinders, and to save space, and to use them for decorations, and it's really good to use open-air music."
"The sound is loud and good, and when you adjust it's okay, don't change it, don't change it, it's easy to move."
"Shop, why can't the YSBM speaker I can't afford to sing?"
"Good materials, smooth, non-symbolic keyboards. Quick connection, switch between smooth devices."
"It's nice, it's pretty, it's tight, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's nice, it's got an iPhone."
"If you really like red, you can pick it; if you don't like blue, it's better black or blue."
"Cameras aren't exactly the same, and in the picture, we're holding cameras and cutting holes for flash and microphones, but the fact that the whole big hole is a bunch of cameras and flash holes, that doesn't protect the oranges. The quality is OK but recommend that the shop take the right picture, the small details are the ones that the buyers need to get the right picture!"
That's great.
"fit, hold, press ok k hard, just sweat your hand out the hole"
It's as beautiful as a five-second delivery.
"The quick delivery color is the same as the quality of good plastic that fits the phone, but the color doesn't work very well with the phone."
"A cheap back, sure, fast delivery Tiki only booked the day before tomorrow."
"The plastic, the fit hug, the quality is better than the price! <i>A good release, the moderate thickness to protect the camera without being too tight.</i> <i>The material seems to be unsatisfactory.</i> <i>It takes time to test it.</i>"
It's okay. It's less hot than it used to be.
It's got to fit right into the machine.
"Although it's irrelevant, the next one's pretty, so I'm not gonna take it off anymore."
It's beautiful and it's brilliant.
I like it very much.
Beautiful product similar to description

"Send the product back unlike him, not the correct sign... has already filed a complaint against Tiki.."
"There's no label on the product body as in the photo, and there's no word for it."
The wrong product has been ordered.
"The quality, the price, doesn't say much."
A week's out of quality.
"Records are too small, can't tune in."
"The sound of the bass is so strong, it's so high, it's so high, it's about five o'clock for a battery."
"It's very satisfying to buy good sp at this price range, nice design with high bass canec, especially for active noise resistance, thanks to the new enthusiastic counsel shop that runs out of hihi."
"In my previous earpiece, I kind of liked this model, this kind of earpiece, but I also had an AKA anti-compression with two other modes. It's pretty easy to adjust and use. the plus for the shop is hddd in detail, sp packaged thoroughly with seal"
"The sound is impossible, the sharp connection OK, the distance to eight meters is still stable. There's three adjusted listening modes. I like it."
"The sound sounds great, bassy, the design of the white box with the inox border also to the point that it's dirty, and there are three sensors that are transformed by touching that are very interested in the AGC feature. The unless there's no audio adjustment that's going to be better, it's going to be better."
"First I feel beautiful design, with steady hands, and then I'm totally surprised by the bass playing music, which is so high, and then the anti-symbolic regimes, and the achets, and she's just, you know, she's, you know, she's, like, she's, like, she's, like, she's, like, she's, like, she's, like, she's, like, she's, like, she's, she's, like, she's, like, she's, like, she's, she's, like, she's, like, she's, like, she's, like, she's, she's, like, she's, she's, like, she's, she's, she's, like, she's, like, she's, like, she's, like, like, she's, like, she's,"
"Sound or bass so chill Pass: there are three modes, in which it's very keen to have ACS anti-involuntary, fast and stable a distance 7-8 meters limit: there's no adjustable volume Anyway. OK."
"I've been in touch with the store for a month, and when I've bought a little bit of headset engineering, I've got to ask for a store change, which is pretty fast, and by the time I've used it, I've used it as well, the quality of sound as I expected."
"Sharp sound, bass sounds or has a very active sound mode. The remote connection is also quite sensitive."
"Bass + loud noise resistance mode very well, wear it just to enjoy music and run, and I'm very happy that the only white one is going to be dirty so you have to be careful."
"There's no critical point in the ear, except to increase the volume on the phone, other factors are percolated."
"Use OK, sensitivity to me prefers the AGC anti-symble mode as in-ear"
"A couple of reviews on the box -- extroverts: nice design with borders, light, but you're clean -- negative: very OK, bass canb is very high, there's three different listening modes -- connection: stable in the pvivi 9m is still stable, non-symptomatic; sensitive, sometimes too sensitive is quite critical: deaf ears, sound sounds good."
"It's fine. Use it very well with three options, even though you can't adjust the volume of your headset but make it sound good."
"Tiki delivers as quickly as possible, in view of the high-sense demand, which is quite surprising and impressive about the sound of the earbuds selling this earbud. It's appropriate for the saint to wear this type of device which has a sound way of adding. The sensor is quite sensitive, touching is sometimes to wear when the gym hits it, too. Sd is long without ear pain, but it's pretty smooth except m: there's no increase in volume."
"The quality of sound is good; there's noise resistance, which is relative, can still hear outside sounds if it's too loud."
"The sound sounds pretty good, and the special thing about this ear is that there are three basic modes / transparency/ with ACC that are also convenient to the environment using different modes of weakness, the only thing that is not going to be able to reduce volume."
Sounds good. The bass hit hard.
"For those of you who wear earpieces with a sound method, this feature I quite like, because long-term ear plugs are a little bit more comfortable with long conversational listening to music, and it's kind of cool when the gym is turned on, so let's give this shop a good judgment on sp."
"The earpiece would be very kind if there was an increase in volume, which is great. Sound is great with three different listening modes that are convenient, bass is good."
"There are three of my favorite modes, especially the AnC, against flexible noise movements, moving in noisy, noisy environments."
"Sp is worth the money for rice, I like it. <i>The most loving transition mode.</i> <i>He flips as if he's wearing in-ear.</i> <i>It's easier to wear this earplug than this spot.</i> <i>The most fun thing I've ever had to do is to wrap up the sum.</i> <i>Two hours.</i>"
"Model this bass sounds pretty good, the point is that there's three changing modes that don't change volume, have to be adjusted on the phone, and if there's a sound adjustment, it's more than cool."
"The product is small and light, but it's very small, sp is beautiful, sounds pretty sound okay, generally good product at the price range,ship 2 hours fast and the package store seal ok the products found in introduction to test the r response again"
"Nice style, stable connection, easy touch, negative substances that don't make a sound on bass, plus three different listening modes."
"Clean approach, sounds very good with this conversion mode, I like sp."
"The earpiece is good, it's tough, it's worth a lot of money, the battery's long-term."
"Everything else's money, the negative material's good. It's pretty convenient. (Laughter) The limit is that there's no volume adjustment."
"The beautiful periphery, which is quite smooth on the ears of one or two ears, is possible - the plus: three listening modes, the most preferentiality, the voiceline is stable, the connection is stable, and the range is pretty far away - minus: there's no increase in volume."
"Pack your stamps with your earmark card using ok after a week of experience, highly recommend"
"Sp, as a description, use the very favorite experience."
"You know, it's better than a string decoup or an ear scan for the hot season and a gym."
It's okay. I don't know if it's going to make it.
"The sound ear is very good at using points, but it doesn't change the volume, but it doesn't matter whether or not you need it, or if you need it, ask for it."
"The plus point for the 3 Convenient Switch modes except k has increased the volume of sensors, but it's a nice periphery."
"The only sound or touch is the sound-sensitivity mode. The only limit is to adjust the volume on Anyway's cell phone, which is pretty good for this valuable ear."
"Great headset, good use. So buy it, Mn."
"The bass used to listen to the side, reducing noise is the hot part. Sensitivity and manipulation are easy. The plus point for the shop is hdsd with very detailed functions and full support."
"The earpiece is very good. I've been using it for a year, but the product is the same as it was at the beginning."
"The whole sequence, the bass is fine, the number of batteries using OK hears four and a half sounds (7080% volume). If the volume goes up, it's even better."
"The most stimulating sound is bass, accompanied by anti-symphony modes when a good gym is dug into a shop."
"Sound's fine after a while, bass's been good and sound-proof. Touch sensitivity is adjustment."
Good.
"Good use, sensors, if you can add volume, then perfect, but also shop 5 with the current features."
"The sharp sound sounds very good, worth the money we're spending, I hope it's sustainable."
"The good stuff, the owner of the store, is passionate about handling the customers."
"Nice, easy to use earpieces, like Anc mode resistance."
"The quality of hearing, as described by the description, the warm counsel shop, sp has a press pass and seal, the Mn can consider this sp"
"It's so high, it's brilliant."
"The delivery's too fast, it's too dangerous."
"Sd is very ok, the three double transfer modes used in many different environments I approve of this mode"
"One day of experience is quite interested in three powerful modes, sounds or bass features."
It's good to buy.
The quality of sound sounds really good.
"Okay, that's cool."
The negative or easy-to-use material is basically consistent with his sd needs.
"Headsets use very well. OK, so buy as long as you don't have earaches."
"UwU's good advice, Base sounds good?"
"Well used, mn, sp suggested we buy it if we need it."
Sounds good to the ear.
The earpiece should buy the Anc mode very fancy to use
Good sound sounds good.

"I've been wondering a lot before I've decided to buy this girl for using Ipad pro 12.9, over the next few months of using it, I actually feel like I'm going to get rid of the following stuff. - Touchpad doesn't have any Mac, it's not going to work. - The keyboard is really heavy, it's going to take away or it's going to be very hard to take, the keyboard isn't always going to work."
"Ipad Pro 12.9 inches as bad as advertising, bad customer service."
Follow me when there's a need to beg for help.

"It's a nice package. It's a very fragile package. It's a very sensitive package. It's a very strong sound, it's not strong sound, it's not funny, it's no different than one earpiece. It's thick and smooth. The hearing ear is definitely heavy; it's not light; it's good design. it doesn't load an app."
The pastel color is too nice. Women's ears are lovely. They're worth the price.

"A good machine at a price, picks up a lot of radios, but sometimes it's timid, sending it back to the country is a plus."
Good.

"My grandfather loved it, and he told me to buy a second one for his friends."
Fine quality
Good.
I'm happy to buy it for you.
It's good. It's loud.
I've been trying to tell you that these two long-year-olds have been in high places.
The price is a little higher than 500k.
"The sales don't have batteries, they don't recommend users on this, they order for the old lady after days of expectation, they can hold the radio, they can't open it, the quality of the product can't be evaluated, but the service from the supplier is not good, it's very frustrating."
"The delivery machine was right, the design was pretty good, picked up FM frequency, MW was good, but the SW frequency was too weak, couldn't catch the outer water stations, the shell was kind of unstable, the crust was hard-wired when you put it down."
"It's normal, it's warm, it's loud, it's relatively stable, it's using it, it's testing it, it's testing it, it's not available, it's not available, it's not available, it's not available."
No batteries attached? <i>Two</i> <i>No source of 3.6v</i> <i>...three radios could not hear AM?</i> <i>The international news channel could not hear?</i> <i>Please explain - >lobal.</i>
"The new shell isn't real skin, it's more like plastic, it's not battery-free, it doesn't have a battery, it doesn't have a power source, it's not there, it's not there, it's not there, it's not there, it's not there, it's not there, it's pretty loud, it's bigger than the cargo."
"The D.C. 3.6 V grid doesn't have the right plug-in wire, so this is the battery power station, before you buy it."
The R20 panasonic battery is only about 10 hours of average volume.
"Fast delivery, normal goods, thin plastic shells, good reception. It's a little high-end compared to the price. If there's more waves, it's too good."
There's only a little limitation on the rope. The price should always be fine.
"We use it, but it's hard to catch it, and it's shy, and we want to open another one, and we don't know if it's ready to change it."
"Panasonic is a famous brand, but I don't understand how the frequencyr is so extreme -- that's why the broadcast time ran out."
"Nice form, good sound."
"Fonzie can hear a few radios, AM can barely hear the radio, I don't know why it's so bad!"
Sounds good to me.
"The waves are weak and noisy, and it's hard to catch the FM stations."
"It doesn't sound good, it doesn't sound good, it doesn't sound big."
Just reading some bullshit.
Disillusionable sound quality is like a toy row
The quality of perfecting the product is a little low.
The vegetarian toss out loud.
"The radio I like around me, hears information all the time."
The speaker's a bit shy.
The package's broken. Check the delivery and package.
Nice rope!
"It's perfect, it's nice and it fits."
Nice.
Okay.
Okay.
Nice.
Nice.
The wire is normal plastic. It's not as soft as the main wire.
"The colors aren't as beautiful as they appear, they look pretty rough."
"The straps are hard, the wires aren't what they look like."
That's great.
It's okay.
"It's good for now, but the glue's low."
"The goods are very bad for the description, the glue is loose, the glue is really disillusioned, the glue is self-resolved, the text is unsolved, the people who are going to buy, the people who are going to get away with it."
The patch quality is too bad.
"Three days, you don't need to use it in general. The tent is very bad."
"Perfecting isn't very nice. It doesn't breathe, it doesn't help."
It's extremely smooth. It's exactly right.
"Good charge, small look, quick charge for both engines at the same time."
"The product is exactly the same as the description, quick battery charge, no heat, two C gates that are convenient to charge two phones at the same time, will support the shop."
"Small charge of fine codes, two fast-loading phones at the same time without quality heat."
The product that comes in for a while is hot and shut down power.
It's not as good as some sp we bought before.
Okay.
"Fast card speed, detailed images, packaged goods, packaged carefully"
"Quick delivery, enthusiastic counsel on second purchases at the shop."
"The four o'clock speed is too good, which is the same speed as the mMC is using."
Speed depends on the range.
"Quick delivery, good speed, steady passage, youth, HN, 30-40mbps. Pretty good for a sim of data."
Speed Shop Warm Support
"Pack your bags carefully, make quick delivery, speed, cost too much money."
"sp is very good, buy sims to activate 360 days. network speed is fast and smooth, put in 4g transmitters using 440 phones is still OK."
Sim uses it fast and steady waves.
"Quick delivery, good product."
"If you've had enough to last 12 months, you'd be able to respond."
"Quick, good for video 4k."
"It's a nodes. I've bought it for the second time. I'll give you my support, I'll give you my support."
Okay.
Good product.
"Strong waves, good quality."
"4G waits for a wave at zero, high speed at low speed. Too boring to install a fiber optic cable network. The tech says it's the reason that sim failed, but the seller won't change."
It's okay. It's okay.
Let's go!
"Sim is OK, in the picture, it's the TPHCM."
"If the Shop is sold without response, I'm calling to get the shop to activate and there's no answer."
Fine.
"I trust tiki very much, but this time I'm giving me my unplugged headset. It's so disappointing."
There's nothing wrong with a guy who's a seller who can't sell a man's house.
"It's just a minute and a minute. It's a dead end. Oh, my God. Oh, my God."
We've lost the battery and the battery won't come in.
"I've spent 10 hours listening to one earpiece, texting a shop, and I can't answer it."
"When you're done getting the good stuff, you're gonna try it out, you're gonna feel like it's okay, it's really good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good to wear, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good."
"I set up the express, but when I got the old earpiece, the one who heard the phone couldn't hear, and did the HD charge full 24 hours to see again, and finally the one who was listening, the one who couldn't hear, the one who was really pissed off."
"The first time the earphones don't connect, the other ones connect the left ear, the left ear."
"You know, if you buy 256k and you can hear it in one ear, and then you can hear it at the other time."
"That's the plus point for me, listening to warm music, so I'm happy to hear this."
"Listen to the music, the shop, the bass ear, it's clear to buy these earpieces, it's not a bad idea, it's a long shop support."
"Invigorating music listening, the price of the money is good for quality, the package that's well packed will support the long-term shop."
"Out of the way, it's beautiful outside, it's really loud, it's unscramble, it's going to support the shop for a long time."
Could not connect DSS. The product is as good as advertised. Requesting a sp test.
"Okay, quick delivery is like the description on the outside of the color. Okay. It's better than the picture."
We've got less than 10 hours of connection. We've got nothing.
The delivery is faster than expected. The small product is connected quickly. The sensor is sensitive. The battery level is reported to use a world. Let's see how the sum of the goods is.
Too bad it doesn't work. I can't get through to the phone.
The connection line hasn't been in three seconds. The battery charges 24 hours. No connection bought for three days.
I've got the package. It looks great. It sounds good. It's not unconnected. It's okay.
"Well, that sounds great. It's always good. It's always good. It's always good."
It's good. It's warm. It's worth the price.
"If you're connected, it's as if you can hear it."
"It's all right, it's all right, it's all right, it's all right. It's all right. It's all right. It's all right."
It's all right. It's all right. It's all right. It's all right. It's all right.
"The headset is fine, the loud sound is clear, the small size is easy to carry, the battery is stable for a long time, the bamboo and bass are balanced, the design is good."
It's very soft. It's a nice little sound. It's cute. Sensitive.
Could not close temporary folder: %s
"Quality ok at the price range, fast delivery, 100 percent durability. We're going to have to wait. We're going to talk, we're going to get it done."
"The earpiece is very pleased with the sample, the excellent quality of sound at the price, especially the bass is fine, the hunting is good, so the price is pretty good."
"buys me a few days' time to review this set, I'm satisfied with design, it's simple, it's neat, it's powerful shop to buy."
It's a big headset. It's a sensitive Bluetooth connection. It's a good sound. It's a great sound.
"The Bluetooth connection is relatively simple, the delay is few, so there's no problem. It's very sound sensitive. It's very good."
"It's small, it's easy to take a bag for the sound part. It's quite OK. It's too good at the price range."
It's okay. It's good. It's good. It's good.
"Quick delivery. It's 100 percent still. Nice design, good hand holding. Sounds good to me personally."
It's okay. It's a shop or something. It's not a big deal.
"Good headset, easy to connect, easy to use, modern style is very catchy."
"It's an enthusiastic delivery worker, it's a very neat style. I love it. It's a good sound."
You guys are looking for a reasonable headset. This is a pretty good headset. Listen to music.
"I've tried my headphones. OK, this is a good choice. Nice headset."
"One side listens to one side, and the other listens very quickly."
"Good stuff, good stuff, good taste, good price. Okay."
"Wow, that's a great earpiece. Small shop. It's easy to get a sound bag. It's all right."
"It's so beautiful. It's okay. It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay. It's five stars."
It's okay. It's okay. It's a quick Teterboro connection. It's a four-hour battery.
"I can't hear you, I can't hear you."
"The battery's gone in a strange way, the battery's full, but it's all ears."
I don't know what kind of a salesman you're talking about.
Right ear's running out of batteries.
There's one on the left. I can't hear it on the right.
I'm so sorry I bought it!
It's worth it. It's worth it.
"Anroid connection is fast, sensors are always on and negative at the price of okie browsing."
"One minute of battery failure, virtual battery failure, very bad for an sp."
"We've just received a package, OK, then we can't hear everything on the right-hand side."
"Good hearing, easy to use, very neat."
"Nice form, good use."
"Sp received no connection, although he tried many devices."
I'll change the new one. I'll put a kilo in the battery.
Nice headset. Good ear. Good ear. Good ear.
"Nice hearing, sure, easy to use, beautiful design."
"It's nice and easy to use, and I like it and I like it."
Can't connect even if you've taken enough steps
The product's bad. It's good for nothing.
No bin. Hurry down to the bin.
It's good to hear. It's good to hear.
"Bad ear, bad ear. I can't afford it, I can't afford it, I can't afford it, I can't afford it, I can't afford it."

It's very nice to buy tikis that are reassuring about quality.
Nice cable is definitely convenient.
"But Tiki delivers the wrong type of output to HDMM and VGA (more expensive, more than 350k)."
"I put the white one in black, the rest of the product I haven't tried, it's fine, I'll review later."

The charge cup failed. Texting to the shop didn't get an answer. The hearing ear saw a poor quality of perfection.
"Advantage: The ear is fine compared to the price of money, the speed connected, the actual image is relative to the point line: The delivery is slow, the charge is off, the charge is only 2 charges, the ear is full of ears is about 4g. No charge button when the battery is not charged, but the battery is not used (put your ear in, the battery is charged)."
"It's too bad. The battery's full, but one side hears one side. No phone. No answer."
I want to return the money.
Just listen on one side.
"Listen, listen to me, okay, but I can't hear a phone call, I can't do it, I can't do it, I can't do it."
The left ear sensors don't eat.
"It's a three-hour charge, waiting to see the durability."
I don't know how to use it.
"buy it in the ear. If you can't hear a message, k rep order it's very quick to order."
I'd like to return the product because of the error.
The battery won't last long.
The right quality is right for the price.
We're good. We're running out of batteries. Sometimes we shut ourselves down.
I've been charging all afternoon and I've only heard one ear.
The earpiece's a little pain in the ear.
Too bad I can't connect. The battery's full.
The microphone's a little low.
"It's warm, but it's easy to fall."
"Except one star, because it's easy to fall."
The device's fine.
It doesn't sound good.
"One ear to the left is interrupted, the battery can't hear three hours."
"It's not easy. It's okay, it's okay."
I'm not gonna hit the shop batteries. Can I change it for you?
"Sure use goods, use hands very much, each one with a lot of adjustments and a lot of screws, because of the 360-degree cell phone, so there's no turning only the edges, so it's a little panic, and it feels a little uncertain, but then you can see that there's no openings."
"I used to buy the same thing, but I couldn't use it, so it's easy to flip."
"The quality of the table doesn't have to be discussed, guys, it's cheap, it's good, it's better, it's a table corner, it's a good max."
"The price of the metal frame is solid, the reach is like a description, even over 60 centimeters."
"Fast, steady lines should be bought"
"The wire is not broken, the head of the network is definitely covered, I changed the network to feel better and more stable than I used to."
"It's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good, it's good."
"Nice, tough, full bandwidth is using the network, but I'm not sure if it's going to reach a standard of cat8 because it doesn't have to go. It's pretty short."
"The cable plate is solid, the cable head is strong, but for more time to see how it's done."
Very good.
"Strong, steady, hoping to buy another."
Sp oke. Fine at the price.
"Eungen,"
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
"After the connection between the modem and the computer, the ping test found the results to be no different than the purchase wire outside the store, but the design of the beautiful, high-end pattern for four stars."
"It says 2 meters, and it posts 3 products with the same label."
"Pack your bags, all right!"
"If you don't have a battery, I think you'll have a chance to use the charge box, the echo function, the livestream support pad, all right?"
"That's good. Danielson, he's bought a lot of lanes."
"The shop started off with a mix-up, but it's settled and sorry, but it's cool, it's prestigious."
Okay.
"He's putting the super-symmumi company that the shop sent to the likguus, which is pretty thick, but he looks pretty square, woody, he's going to use again, and he's going to put up another thin, hope the shop doesn't send the wrong samples."
