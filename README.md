# Customer Data Analysis from E-Commerce Platforms

The rapid growth of e-commerce has made customer data an invaluable resource for businesses looking to enhance their operational efficiency and improve decision-making. This project aims to analyze customer data from popular e-commerce platforms such as Tiki, Lazada, and Dien May Xanh, focusing on extracting valuable insights about customer behavior, purchasing trends, and key factors influencing buying decisions.

By leveraging this analysis, businesses can optimize marketing strategies, personalize user experiences, and refine their services to achieve higher customer satisfaction and increased revenue. This project combines structured (ratings, product categories) and unstructured (review text) data to deliver actionable insights, while addressing challenges such as data cleaning, sentiment analysis, and topic modeling using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.
